  <p>I use an <a href="https://iqunix.com/products/magi65">IQUNIX Magi65</a> keyboard at home, and absolutely love it. I didn&rsquo;t get the Pro version, as I don&rsquo;t really need a dial or media keys, and I preferred the smaller size anyways. The only real criticism I noticed in reviews was that the keyboard is pretty heavy, but this turned out to be a good thing for me. I don&rsquo;t want to carry the thing around with me, and I love the solidity as I type. The typing experience is fantastic.</p>
<p>I wanted a nice keyboard at work, too, and felt weird about buying 2 of the same keyboard. I figured this was a good opportunity to try something else, so I got the <a href="https://nuphy.com/collections/keyboards/products/nuphy-air75-v3-page">NuPhy Air75 V3</a> for the office. This was also well-reviewed, and is quite a bit lighter. It seems like people who want low-profile mechanical keyboards also value portability, which makes sense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been giving it a fair chance, but I have to admit that I really don&rsquo;t like it very much. For lack of a better vocabulary, the keys just feel too light. I find myself mistyping a lot for some reason, and I think it has to do with the keys being pressed very easily without a lot of bounce-back. Maybe I just have to learn to be gentler with my typing? I&rsquo;m not sure, but it&rsquo;s been a while and I still haven&rsquo;t gotten used to it.</p>
<p>Then, I came across the <a href="https://shop.beekeeb.com/products/toucan-wireless-piantor-wireless-split-keyboard-with-touchpad">Toucan</a>, which is just absolutely gorgeous. I had never really considered a split keyboard, but I fell in love with this one.</p>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t bought one. I&rsquo;m worried about losing so many keys, but this has definitely triggered an interest in split keyboards, and the <a href="https://github.com/foostan/crkbd">Corne layout</a> especially. I can&rsquo;t justify getting this as a daily driver, or spending so much money on a side-toy, but I&rsquo;m been browsing used markets for a cheap entry model. Who knows, maybe one day I&rsquo;ll find The One and dive off the deep end.</p>
<p>So what about my work keyboard? I might just get another Magi65, because it is by far my favorite typing experience.</p>
