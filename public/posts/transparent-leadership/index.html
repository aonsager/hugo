  <p>From <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/transparent-leadership-beats-servant-leadership">Transparent Leadership Beats Servant Leadership</a>, by Chris at <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/index">Entropic Thoughts</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my book, a good leader</p>
<p>coaches people,<br>
connects people,<br>
[. . .]<br>
creates direct links between supply and demand (instead of deliberately making themselves a middle man),<br>
[. . .]<br>
generally makes themselves redundant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really related with many of the points in this post. Coincidentally, I had just recently come to some similar conclusions at my own workplace, too.</p>
<p>Effective leaders enable people to solve problems and make progress on their own, so the presence of the best leaders will probably be hard to notice.</p>
<p>I am reminded of a quote from Lao-Tzu (or at least one version of its translation) that has stuck in my mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A leader is best when people barely know he exists. When his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: We did it ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would often place myself as a middle man in communications deliberately, especially when I was invested in the communication and the other parties involved were also busy doing other things at the same time. The intent was that I could steer the conversation to an efficient consensus, by framing the discussions and paraphrasing or summarizing (what I thought to be) the important points.</p>
<p>In reality though, I was often doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>By placing myself in the middle of communications, I make myself a bottleneck. If <em>I</em> was busy doing something else, I might delay responses, and it was often faster to just have the two people talk to each other directly.</p>
<p>And when I put information through my own filter of what I felt was important or not, It&rsquo;s too easy to get the nuance wrong. Even if things seemed to work out at the time, small differences in understanding can compound over time and turn into a bigger problem in the future. In these cases too, I think now that it&rsquo;s more effective to just have everyone speak to each other directly.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone can be talking to everyone else all the time, and determining how much is too much might be an area where my input could help. But in general, I&rsquo;m trying very hard not to speak for other people, and am trying instead to be someone who can connect people <em>to each other</em> quickly and efficiently.</p>
