  <p>For a long time, I&rsquo;ve avoided collecting too much stuff. I buy Kindle versions of books whenever possible, but there is a small shelf for the few books I have carried around with me over the years. My son, who is not quite two years old, will sometimes rummage through my books and leave them in a heap once he realizes there are no pictures, but it made me remember what my own father&rsquo;s bookshelf was like for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I found <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> on his bookshelf, and I ended up reading it countless times as I grew up. I found <em>The Hobbit</em>, which led to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, and then whatever other high fantasy I could get my hands on. I found <em>The Royal Road to Card Magic</em>, and my interest in card magic ended up being a pretty big part of my life after that. I didn&rsquo;t read <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em>, but I recognized it from that bookshelf when I was introduced to it many years later.</p>
<p>A bookshelf creates serendipity. I encountered those books early, before anybody would have thought, &ldquo;Ah, I know just the book that would interest this young man.&rdquo; And discovering something of my dad&rsquo;s and taking it for myself was much more exciting than being told, &ldquo;Hey come look at this thing I liked when I was your age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, since I&rsquo;m the father now, I went and bought a big bookshelf for myself. I want to go through my parents&rsquo; storage to reclaim my favorite books, and I&rsquo;ll slowly fill out my own bookshelf with books I think are worth keeping around – just in reach for my kids to discover on their own.</p>
