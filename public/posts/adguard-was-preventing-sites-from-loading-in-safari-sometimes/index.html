  <p>For some reason, some sites would not load in Safari. Certain assets, often hosted on a CDN but not always, would hang forever and keep the page from loading. Other browsers worked, curl worked, so it didn&rsquo;t seem like a DNS issue. It was driving me crazy.</p>
<p>I think I finally caught the culprit: Adguard&rsquo;s network filtering.</p>
<p>Adguard gives you the option to filter all of your internet traffic for various apps on your computer. By default, it does so through a &ldquo;Network Extension&rdquo; that registers a local VPN to filter all traffic.</p>
<p>For some reason, this was tripping up just Safari and stopping certain assets from loading. An alternative mode called &ldquo;Automatic Proxy&rdquo; is available to avoid conflicts with other VPN applications and such, and switching to this mode seems to have fixed the problem for me. Good!</p>
