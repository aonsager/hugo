  <h1>Bike rides for my wandering mind</h1>

  
  
  <time datetime="2025-05-29T13:51:00&#43;09:00">May 29, 2025</time>

  <p>My daily commute includes a 20-minute bike ride to the train station. I started this as a way to keep my body moving, but I&rsquo;ve come to love it for the freedom it gives my mind. I can think about whatever I want to, but it&rsquo;s also all right to not think about anything.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>The weather is nice today, and I listen to the birds talking at one another.</em></p>
<p><em>The sun has started getting higher in the sky when I leave, so I&rsquo;ll probably want to start wearing my sunglasses again soon.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I can look ahead to what I will do today, or work through a tricky problem I&rsquo;ve been stuck on. Or I can look around and notice things around me.</p>
<p>Or I can let my mind wander and think about any random thing. Or I can just focus on riding the bike.</p>
<p>Or I can space out for a while.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter, and there&rsquo;s no pressure.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>I see the nice older lady who lives a few streets down walking her Shiba. I slow down to say hello, and she wishes me a good day at work. I don&rsquo;t actually know her name, and my window to ask politely has long passed. But I do know her dog&rsquo;s name, and she knows our kids&rsquo; names, and we talk every now and then. She&rsquo;s very soft-spoken and polite.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;ve considered listening to music while I ride, or a even a podcast, but the idea is just viscerally unappealing to me.</p>
<p>We spend so much of our time putting things <em>in</em>, though our eyes, or our ears. Consumption is implied to be productive, which means passing up on an opportunity to consume is a poor use of your time. I don&rsquo;t buy it. I <em>won&rsquo;t</em> be productive while I&rsquo;m on a bike.</p>
<p>I like having this time to myself, to take a break from the pressure to put anything <em>in</em>, or to push anything <em>out</em>. Confession: sometimes I hold my breath, just for a change of pace from always breathing in and breathing out and breathing in and breathing out.</p>
<p>I suppose this is what leads many people to meditation, but I don&rsquo;t have the discipline to make time like that at home. If I ever had a quiet 30 minutes to do with as I please (fellow parents of young children are laughing along with me), I would, with zero hesitation or regret, use it to play <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>I shift my hips and counter-steer to ease into the turn.</em></p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really feel like I&rsquo;m <em>turning</em>, in the strictest sense of the word. I <em>push</em> down and bend the bike&rsquo;s motion through careful twists while I stay centered on top. Riding a bicycle is one of the few physical activities that give me joy to perform. I feel extremely comfortable on a bike, and I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate that more and more.</p>
<p><em>Gently weaving back and forth between the manhole covers is a game I play while looking for the smoothest path.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Here&rsquo;s the big hill that lets me get going pretty darn fast on the way down. I know I need to be careful, but I just can&rsquo;t help it. I feel the wind blast my face, and hear it whistle around my ears.</em></p>
<p>I love to go fast. That is something that I&rsquo;ve come to recognize about myself. On skis or a snowboard, I would always end up going <em>just a little bit</em> too fast. When I reach the bottom I am sweating, with burning legs and a big grin on my face. There&rsquo;s something tremendously satisfying about hitting those speeds using only my body and a plank of reduced friction.</p>
<p><em>How fast am I going now? It must be at least 30km/h, but honestly it probably feels a lot faster than it actually is.</em></p>
<p>Riding a motorcycle, too — that was a special experience. I only had mine for about 6 months before selling it to move out of the country, but I still vividly remember how it feels. With just a little twist of your wrist <em>like so</em>, you&rsquo;re immediately <em>pulled</em> forward by the tank of raw power you&rsquo;re sitting on. So easy, and so liberating. All of that power sitting right there, ready, just waiting for you to lean forward and whisper, &ldquo;<em>Yes, you may</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t dedicated bike paths here, but most of my route goes through small residential streets so it&rsquo;s very pleasant. You do need to be careful though, around the many branching side-streets.</p>
<p><em>There is more foot traffic here, and the person riding ahead is going fairly slowly. I could try to pass, but the streets are narrow, so I&rsquo;ll just ride slower for a while and stay behind. That&rsquo;s fine.</em></p>
<p>The most important thing when riding a bike through a little city like this is to be aware of your surroundings so that you can anticipate what might happen. The next most important thing is to know when to slow down, or to even stop for a second. Too many people will do anything at all <em>except</em> slow down.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>For some reason there is a fairly big rice paddy here, right behind a modern apartment building. Who own this? Why did they decide on this spot to create a rice paddy?</em></p>
<p><em>The muddy water is accented by neat rows of small green sprigs — they must have planted them pretty recently. In the summer, this entire field will become shockingly green.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve arrived at the bicycle parking lot at the station. You have to get a ticket at the machine when you go in, and there&rsquo;s a lady in front of me. The screen says &ldquo;Push the button for a ticket&rdquo; and she&rsquo;s pushing the picture of the button, thinking it&rsquo;s a touch-screen. I point her to the big green button that&rsquo;s below the screen. She laughs. She thanks me, and we laugh together.</em></p>
