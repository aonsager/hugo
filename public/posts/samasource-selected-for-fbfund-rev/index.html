  <p>Hooray! Along with 18 companies and one other non-profit, <strong>Samasource was chosen to participate in fbFund’s incubator program this summer</strong>. Check out the full list of winners on <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2009/05/28/fbfund-17-companies-and-2-nonprofits-win-head-to-palo-alto/">VentureBeat</a> or <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2009/05/28/facebook-announces-19-2009-fbfund-winners/">InsideFacebook</a>.</p>
<p>What this means is that we’ll have Palo Alto office space, lots of media attention, an official Facebook seal of approval, and possibly free lunches <em>/crossfingers</em>. The catch?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to the way fbFund is structured, the non-profit startups cannot receive funding (<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=249">Facebook dev blog</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bummer&hellip;</p>
<p>Samasource’s Facebook product will allow developers to create work opportunities for underprivileged workers by setting up periodic testing for their active applications. <strong>With Samasource, developers lower costs, reduce poverty, and improve their applications</strong>. Being chosen as a fbFund winner, despite not entailing cash, is extremely significant. Samasource, along with Vittana, the other non-profit winner, is poised to be a frontrunner of social entrepreneurship within the Facebook ecosystem. Being able to work with Facebook officially should greatly increase product quality, market penetration, and overall social impact. Samasource also will provide a valuable service to application developers, so I have high hopes for the success of this project.</p>
<p>Now a quick word about changes within fbFund. Previously the fund awarded grants to the winners, but this year the funding is in the form of an equity investment (more coverage <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2009/04/16/facebooks-fbfund-incubator-program-looks-to-cash-in-on-the-sites-growth/">here</a>). This makes sense, and I think it’s a reasonable change. It does put the non-profits in an awkward spot, but I believe that’s just growing pains. Two non-profits were chosen this year, and that’s a big deal. Optimism tells me that <strong>social entrepreneurship will hold a much more prominent position in the years to come</strong>. Exciting things are happening in the world of social change, and Samasource is fortunate enough to be able to make an impact in a high-visibility environment. We will not disappoint.</p>
