      <p>A list of things I want to prioritize when choosing and customizing whatever static-site generator I use for building this site.</p>
<p>Currently using: <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, but not enthusiastically

<h2 id="1-just-let-me-write-my-words">1. Just let me write my words</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently realized that including software-specific text in my post and pages creates a lot of mental overhead. I make use of a number of handy shortcode functions. For example, creating an image block with descriptions and alt code, with an optional caption using <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> if I want to provide extra commentary or link back to the source. This is handy, but there are two big problems:</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/min-max-hobbies/">Don’t min-max your hobbies</a></h2>
      <p>When I’m having fun with a hobby, nothing kills my motivation faster than learning about a better, more efficient way I could be doing things.</p>
<p>I was playing Fantasy Life i – chopping trees, making boots, fishing fish, and just generally having a grand time. It felt like alchemy skills were taking longer than the rest to level up, so i checked a wiki to see if i was missing something. Big mistake. What i learned is that, if i haven’t created 4 sunglasses with EXP boost buffs and then started crafting 10 thousand health potions to power level, I’m wasting my time.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/buy-local/">Buy local</a></h2>
      <p>I look at reviews before buying things, and I prefer personal websites and youtube channels over large publications because I can get a feel for the person behind the opinions, and their preferences. I&rsquo;ve noticed though that reviews gravitate towards a certain subset of good, but mostly American brands. This is only a problem because I live in Japan, where limited availability and terrible exchange rates makes everything feel twice as expensive as they ought to be.</p>

<h2 id="-games">🎮️ Games</h2>
<h3 id="dragon-quest-v">Dragon Quest V</h3>
<p>I was always a Nintendo kid, and have played very few <em>Dragon Quest</em> or <em>Final Fantasy</em> games. I&rsquo;d heard that is one of the best, and I finally grabbed the iOS port this year. Among other things, I was really impressed by the clever usage of game mechanics to tell story.</p>

<p>2025 was the first year that I maintained a physical journal for the entire year. I had never been able to continue the habit, and admired people who could. My goal was pretty simple – at the end of the year, have a journal that I wrote in consistently for 12 months. This has been a success!</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/hacked/">I was hacked!</a></h2>
      <p><a href="https://blog.jakesaunders.dev/my-server-started-mining-monero-this-morning/">Jake Saunders wrote</a> about discovering that a recent Next.js vulnerability allowed hackers access to their server through an Umami instance. I use Umami, too!</p>
<p>I logged into my VPS and didn&rsquo;t see any suspicious files or running processes. I then opened my Umami dashboard to poke around, and my browser immediately opened a window to a gambling site. Well, shit.</p>
<h2 id="damage-assessment">Damage assessment</h2>
<p>The browser&rsquo;s developer console showed that an <code>onclick</code> event was added to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> object, and this was originating from a file disguised to look like a standard Next.js library file used by Umami. So the attacker was able to modify and add files, as well as spoof the modified date to hide their tracks.</p>

      <p>From <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/transparent-leadership-beats-servant-leadership">Transparent Leadership Beats Servant Leadership</a>, by Chris at <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/index">Entropic Thoughts</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my book, a good leader</p>
<p>coaches people,<br>
connects people,<br>
[. . .]<br>
creates direct links between supply and demand (instead of deliberately making themselves a middle man),<br>
[. . .]<br>
generally makes themselves redundant.</p>

<p>I really related with many of the points in this post. Coincidentally, I had just recently come to some similar conclusions at my own workplace, too.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/r-keyboards/">Rambling about — Keyboards</a></h2>
      <p>I use an <a href="https://iqunix.com/products/magi65">IQUNIX Magi65</a> keyboard at home, and absolutely love it. I didn&rsquo;t get the Pro version, as I don&rsquo;t really need a dial or media keys, and I preferred the smaller size anyways. The only real criticism I noticed in reviews was that the keyboard is pretty heavy, but this turned out to be a good thing for me. I don&rsquo;t want to carry the thing around with me, and I love the solidity as I type. The typing experience is fantastic.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/paste-slides/">Copy and paste across Google Slides</a></h2>
      <p>I wanted to copy slides from one Google Slide document to another. Half-expecting it to not work, I just copied slides in one document, switched to a different tab, hit paste&hellip; and it worked! Seamless and perfect.</p>
<p>It looks like when you copy slides, your clipboard actually saves a special payload that contains information about the slides you are copying, rather than the raw content. Then when you paste that into a Slides document, it retrieves the slide data from its servers and imports them to the second document. I imagine you have to be logged into the same Google account in both tabs for it to work properly.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/experience-record/">To experience, rather than record</a></h2>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/p/i-deleted-my-second-brain">Joan Westenberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PKM systems promise coherence, but they often deliver a kind of abstracted confusion. The more I wrote into my vault, the less I felt. A quote would spark an insight, I’d clip it, tag it, link it - and move on. But the insight was never lived. It was stored. Like food vacuum-sealed and never eaten, while any nutritional value slips away.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I first started using PKM tools, I believed I was solving a problem of forgetting. Later, I believed I was solving a problem of integration. Eventually, I realized I had created a new problem: deferral. The more my system grew, the more I deferred the work of thought to some future self who would sort, tag, distill, and extract the gold.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/cdp/">Communication-driven productivity</a></h2>
      <p>Or, &ldquo;The latest chapter in my fool&rsquo;s quest to discover a productivity framework that magically makes me effortlessly productive&rdquo;. So it goes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always considered my todo list as a list of things I need to do (for obvious reasons). But I had a minor epiphany and realized that, in my current role, everything I do has exactly zero value <em>until I communicate it to the right people</em>.</p>
<p>For example: One big item on my todo list now is to finish writing a proposal for improving how we evaluate new game ideas. But if the overarching objective is &ldquo;<em>Improve how we evaluate new game ideas</em>&rdquo;, the direct actions to achieve this are &ldquo;<em>Convince the right important people and get approval</em>&rdquo;, followed by &ldquo;<em>Tell everybody about the changes</em>&rdquo;. These are accompanied by the prerequisite sub-tasks, &ldquo;<em>Write up a convincing proposal</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>Update the existing guideline documents</em>&rdquo;.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/bike-rides-wandering-mind/">Bike rides for my wandering mind</a></h2>
      <p>My daily commute includes a 20-minute bike ride to the train station. I started this as a way to keep my body moving, but I&rsquo;ve come to love it for the freedom it gives my mind. I can think about whatever I want to, but it&rsquo;s also all right to not think about anything.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/old-japan-photos/">Photos of Japan that haven&#39;t changed in 150 years</a></h2>
      <p>I was pointed to an <a href="https://cosmographia.substack.com/p/photographs-of-old-japan">article on Cosmographia</a> which in turn shared <a href="https://sova.si.edu/record/fsa.a1999.35?s=0&amp;n=10&amp;t=C&amp;q=japan&amp;i=1">an archive of photos taken in 19th century Japan</a>. These are amazing photos, but what struck me was how <em>familiar</em> some of them felt. Photos taken from 150 years ago should feel like looking into another world, but some of these scenes, the architecture, are still very present today. It makes it clear how cultural artifacts are so remarkably well-preserved here.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/pay-a-subscription/">If you love something, pay a subscription fee</a></h2>
      <p>As a rule of thumb, you are more likely to be satisfied by a service that you pay for directly. This is because paying money makes you a <em>customer</em> of the business, and the business is thereby directly motivated to keep you satisfied.</p>
<p>If you want to find a service that will satisfy you for a long time, <em>paying a subscription</em> is your best bet.</p>
<p>Here are some facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>In general, a business aims to please its customers.</li>
<li>A business&rsquo;s customers are <em>those who pay it money</em>.</li>
<li>If you do not pay money to a business, you are not its customer.</li>
</ol>
<p>A user of a service who does not pay is, strictly speaking, not a customer. In most cases, the needs of the user and the needs of the customer are not too far apart, so many non-paying users are generally satisfied. But on average, in the long run, the needs of the non-user customer and the needs of the non-customer users will drift apart.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/identity-vs-community/">Identity and Community on the Fediverse</a></h2>
      <p><a href="https://fediverse.info">The Fediverse</a>, a network of interconnected social media services, requires users to choose a service for their account, tying their identity to that community. This can be problematic if the community experiences issues like spam, moderation problems, or shutdown. If we could decouple identity from community, like Reddit did with subreddits, users could more freely participate in multiple communities — and the network overall would be more accessible and resilient.</p>

<p>On April 13th in Shibata City of Niigata prefecture (Japan), the popular idol group <a href="https://www.momoclo.net">Momoiro Clover Z</a> had been planning a large music festival in cooperation with a large number of other artists, as well as local police, schools, and city government. However, on the day of festival the weather took a turn for the worse, and warnings were issued for strong winds, flash floods, and avalanches.</p>

<h3 id="the-structure">The structure</h3>
<p>My first inspiration was the concept of <a href="https://slashpages.net">slash pages</a>, which I love — they are very easy to understand, and have a fun vibe characteristic of simple webpages that are just collections of pages. I wanted to take it a step further, and use the structure of the website as a design feature. The navigation element is arranged like a file system, and the current page&rsquo;s URL is displayed prominently in the header.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/outgrowing-coolify/">I may have outgrown Coolify</a></h2>
      <p>I initially chose <a href="https://coolify.io/">Coolify</a> as a self-hosted alternative to Heroku when it got too expensive. Coolify makes a lot of things very easy, but I ended up having to dig in to the details and learn a lot to fix things that didn&rsquo;t work. Now that I have learned a fair bit about server management, I&rsquo;ve found that I may no longer need Coolify&rsquo;s hand-holding.</p>
<h2 id="venturing-into-self-hosting">Venturing into self-hosting</h2>
<p>I knew next to nothing about Linux servers, Docker, reverse proxies, and the like. I had used Heroku for a long time, but its base price became restrictively expensive considering how small each of my little projects was, so I started looking for a service that could ease me into self-hosting my apps on a VPS.</p>

      <p>I am a mediocre photographer at best, but of course I want to improve. When I saw that <a href="https://social.lol/@hiro">@hiro</a> was putting together 5-week challenge to experiment with various compositional techniques and share our photos, I had to join.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have fancy gear, or a lot of time to go hunting for photos, so almost all of my shots were scenes from my daily life, taken with an iPhone. I realized pretty quickly though, that being deliberate about composition gave a new perspective on even familiar scenes, and I was surprised at compelling some of the photos turned out.</p>

Nothing, including any errors, was showing up in any logs. At first I thought there was something wrong with my crontab, but other scripts set up to run in the same way were running without issue.</p>
<p>Copying the commands in crontab to the terminal and running it manually worked. It was only when cron was triggering the run that it failed.</p>

      <p>The white-spotted pufferfish, or <a href="https://amami-horizon.com/en/nature/ocean/amami-hoshizorafugu">Amami hoshizora fugu</a>, is a species of pufferfish newly discovered in 2014 near Japan&rsquo;s Amami-Oshima Island. The males spend roughly a week constructing an elaborate circular nest about 2 meters in diameter to attract females.</p>
<p>Divers had known about these structures that appear in early summer every year, but apparently it took a while to catch the fish in action.</p>

      <p>A distinguished actor appeared on TV and talked about their love for juggling. They had taken lessons at various times and always sets aside time to practice because they enjoy it so much. They then recounted how they recently met their juggling teacher of ~10 years past, displayed their current juggling skills, and was met with astonishment at how <em>they had not improved one bit in all that time!</em></p>
<p>It was a funny story, but what struck me was just how <em>nice</em> it was that juggling was a constant source of enjoyment for this person <em>despite apparently being no good at it</em>. That&rsquo;s a hard thing to do.</p>

      <p>I have always been a calm and happy person. Aggressively optimistic, even. I made it through the first 1/3 of my life without feeling much stress, only getting angry on rare occasions. Anger management, emotional therapy, mindfulness exercises, these were all things that I had no need for.</p>
<p>I thought that this was a personality trait, but now I realize that I was simply blessed with an easy life. It&rsquo;s not that I was particularly good at dealing with stress, I just didn&rsquo;t have much stress coming my way.</p>

      <p>I first started this personal website just about 20 years ago. It began as a couple of html pages, and spent time as a Wordpress blog, a Tumblr page, and is now a static blog generated by Jekyll.

<p>When I started this site I had just entered university, got my first MacBook, and was excited to become a full-fledged citizen of the internet. At the time, I thought it was cool to publish as much of yourself as possible. Tag yourself and your friends in the photos you take, scrobble the music you listen to, check in to the places you go, tweet your thoughts. Since I was broadcasting myself to the world, it made sense to put my name on my website. That’s how people would know me.</p>

Compared to Mastodon which required a fair amount of server overhead (more than I could justify for just playing around online), GoToSocial is very <a href="https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/getting_started/#server-vps">lightweight</a>: 1 CPU, 1GB memory, and 15GB-20GB of storage space for the first year or so.

<p>This would let me set up my own single-user server, which solves all of my misgivings about Mastodon.</p>

<p>I have a VPS with <a href="https://coolify.io">Coolify</a> to manage the multiple apps I have running, and all things considered it makes things very easy.<br>

      <p>For some reason, some sites would not load in Safari. Certain assets, often hosted on a CDN but not always, would hang forever and keep the page from loading. Other browsers worked, curl worked, so it didn&rsquo;t seem like a DNS issue. It was driving me crazy.</p>
<p>I think I finally caught the culprit: Adguard&rsquo;s network filtering.</p>
<p>Adguard gives you the option to filter all of your internet traffic for various apps on your computer. By default, it does so through a &ldquo;Network Extension&rdquo; that registers a local VPN to filter all traffic.</p>

      <p>Just using iCloud sync has been pretty solid in my experience. I have two Macs and one iPhone that share a single vault, and I&rsquo;ve had no major issues&hellip; except for one.</p>
<p>Because the entire Obsidian folder lives inside of iCloud, the <code>.obsidian</code> settings folder is also synced. Usually a good thing, except that the multi-pane view I have setup for desktop keeps getting pushed onto mobile. Because the panes all become tiny, and because Obsidian reverts to this view every time I use the app on desktop again, Obsidian basically became unusable on my phone.</p>

      <p>The elevator in our office building has a small LCD panel that shows information like the current floor, but when the total weight of passengers crosses a certain threshold it also adds a short note: &ldquo;Sorry the elevator is crowded&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It struck me – of all possible features for an elevator display, how did they decide that they needed this one? It has no impact on the elevator&rsquo;s function of moving people vertically. And a crowded elevator is not the elevator&rsquo;s fault (although this is most likely just an example of Japan&rsquo;s self-deprecating approach to hospitality). So why was this message deemed necessary?</p>

<p>The idea is to photograph people (with permission) who are wearing headphones in the city. Their photo will be shown along with the song they happened to be listening to. It would be interesting to see if a viewer would see any correlation between a person&rsquo;s visual appearance and their taste in music. The prompt &ldquo;What song was playing right now&rdquo; is much more interesting than &ldquo;What is your favorite music,&rdquo; and some people might think that I caught them at just the wrong time, making things more fun for me.</p>

<p>At university, I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style">The Elements of Style</a> and quickly became an advocate instead of lean, effective prose. I strove to convey my thoughts using fewer words. Composition took more effort as I scrutinized each phrase.

<p><em>Detroit: Become Human</em> is a story-heavy adventure game developed by Quantic Dream, the studio I knew best as the creators of <em>Heavy Rain</em>.</p>
<p>The story takes place in a future where androids are commonplace and indistinguishable from humans aside from a computer chip placed on their temple. Predictably, the androids are mistreated and repressed by humans, and you eventually find yourself in the middle of a robot uprising.</p>

<p>Located east of Hiroshima in the Seto Inland Sea, Ōkunoshima (大久野島) is a small island home to over 700 rabbits. The rabbits are wild but friendly, and tourists arrive every day with bags full of food and treats. The island was relatively unknown in Japan until recently when its populality among foreign visitors brought it into the spotlight.</p>

<p>Ōkunoshima today is a paradise of cuteness, but its origins are sinister. Chosen for its remote location, it contained secret facilities used to develop and produce poison gas for chemical weapons. The island was erased from maps at the time to hide its existence. The ruins of these facilities still exist, covered by moss and providing a grim backdrop for those who choose to explore the island.</p>

This is huge news, since before this we only had theoretical proofs of black holes with no direct evidence.</p>
<p>A black hole technically doesn&rsquo;t look like anything since it emits no light, so I understand this to be a capture of light that came very close to the black hole. It appears in a very distinct way that confirms the presence of a black hole.</p>

Many of them are artists who need to minimize the glare on their screens, so the great big windows covering the walls of our room are always covered with blinds, and we instead have fluorescent lights turned on (these do cause glare too, but at least they are more predictable so people can tilt their screens to minimize it).</p>

      <p>During my last year at university, I decided to learn to swim. I was reasonably confident in my ability to stay afloat in deep water and not die, but it wasn&rsquo;t what you could call swimming. Luckily, two of my close friends were excellent swimmers and they agreed to work with me in the mornings before class.</p>
<p>As an aside, I did take swimming lessons on and off for a few years when I was a kid, but apparently I retained nothing from those classes. Maybe I was just a terrible swimmer the entire time? Possibly related, <a href="/i-grew-up-in-high-school">I have very few memories from my elementary and middle school years</a>, so I have a suspicion that I didn&rsquo;t do a whole lot of thinking when I was a kid.

      <p><em><a href="http://kametome.net/index.html">One Cut of the Dead (カメラを止めるな！)</a></em> is a low budget Japanese zombie movie that became hugely popular here. I just watched it over the weekend and it was wonderful. The writing is very funny and very clever, and when it was over I found myself immediately wanting to watch it a second time.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Cut_of_the_Dead">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One Cut of the Dead was made for 3 million Japanese Yen (approximately $25,000 in US Dollars at the time) with a cast of unknown actors. It was made in eight days after director Shinichiro Ueda participated in workshops for actors and filmmakers at the Enbu Seminar drama school in Tokyo</p>

      <p>For a long time I thought I didn&rsquo;t like carbonara because the few I tried were too creamy and eggy. Recently I gave it another try because the picture in the menu looked delicious. It was excellent, and I decided I wanted to learn how to make it myself. I needed some practice before I felt comfortable with the timings, but overall it&rsquo;s a pretty simple recipe that wasn&rsquo;t hard to learn.</p>

      <p>I was consistently able to have lucid dreams when I was in high school. Partway through a dream, I would realize that I was dreaming and could then control the rest of the dream to a small extent. As I&rsquo;ve grown older though, this has become less and less common. Maybe age has changed something about my brain.</p>
<p>Naturally, I&rsquo;ve been interested in lucid dreaming and have read a lot about it. <a href="https://tim.blog/2009/09/21/how-to-lucid-dream/">Tim Ferriss has a fascinating beginner&rsquo;s guide on his blog</a>. Different people seem to have different approaches and theories, so I thought I would write about my own experiences.</p>

      <p>I wonder sometimes about what a better society than ours would be. What should our goals be as we try to improve?</p>
<p>As our society improves and we get more efficient, I like to imagine a future where we don&rsquo;t have to work as much. That seems like a nice thing to aim for. Universal basic income (UBI) seems like one possible solution. If we could afford to give everybody a fixed minimal income, people could work less and still have a basic amount of wealth needed to survive. But I&rsquo;m not yet convinced whether UBI is the correct answer to describe an ideal future.</p>

      <p>I had been playing World of Warcraft on and off for about 10 years, but I decided to stop playing again about a year ago. I quit because of a series of changes that were made to the game, and it motivated me to think about why I reacted that way as a paying customer.</p>
<p>A series of recent changes made to WoW were designed to motivate players to play by ensuring they always gain something and grow a little every time they play. Unfortunately, a side effect of these changes was an increased pressure to spend many hours playing. This made me feel like my limited time spent in the game was less valuable, and is what ultimately led to me quitting the game.</p>

      <p>The best way to cook popcorn in a pan. The secret is to heat up the kernels evenly in hot oil first, before heating them over a flame to pop them quickly all at once.</p>
<ol>
<li>Coat the bottom of a pan with a small amount of oil and place over medium heat.</li>
<li>Put three popcorn kernels in the pan and wait for all three to pop.</li>
<li>Put the rest of the kernels in the pan, cover with a lid, and <strong>remove from the heat</strong> for 30 seconds.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This heats the kernels evenly, getting them all ready to pop together.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Return the pan to the heat, where the popcorn should start popping right away.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It helps to keep the lid ajar and shake the pan occasionally to keep the popcorn dry.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Once the popping slows to a few seconds between pops, pour the popcorn into a bowl.</li>
<li>Add salt to taste.</li>

      <h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p>Play Pac-Man online against other players. 1 player plays as Pac-Man and 4 other players play as the ghosts. Pac-Man&rsquo;s goal is to collect as many dots as possible, and the ghosts&rsquo; goal is to work together to catch Pac-Man. Players receive points at the end of the round based on performance, and roles are rotated for the next round.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>In terms of strategy, the ghosts will need to work together in order to win. Pac-Man will move faster than the ghosts, so the ghosts&rsquo; main strategy will be to trap Pac-Man in a corner. To encourage teamwork, all ghosts will receive the same amount of points at the end of round regardless of who actually caught Pac-Man.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot recently about what benefits there are to building a new product on a blockchain. Blockchains allow an app to be decentralized, and the biggest value they bring is a solid way to handle trust and consensus in an environment with no central authority. I was having a hard time thinking of products that would really benefit from being decentralized, but I came across an idea about decentralized platforms that makes a very strong case for using blockchains.</p>

      <p>When I started using Facebook in 2005, it was exclusive to college students and was by far the best way to communicate with my classmates. It was the first time I could learn what my friends were up to without asking each one individually. Everything I wanted to know about my friends was in one easily accessible place.</p>
<p>All recent updates were shown as one long list, but Facebook eventually introduced the News Feed. This was an effort to filter everyone&rsquo;s updates to show just the most important ones. Facebook made educated guesses about whose updates were most important to you and hid the ones you wouldn&rsquo;t care about. I think they also kept an option to see all updates in chronological order if you didn&rsquo;t want to miss out on anything.</p>

      <p>I grew up in the 90s, and back then video games were made for kids. Toys were for kids, and video games were just the newest, most exciting toys around.</p>
<p>But as my generation grew up, we never really stopped playing games. As we became adults, the game companies kept making games for us, and games shifted to targeting an older audience. It makes sense that these would be successful since adults have more money to spend on games than kids do. Video games became a form of entertainment just like movies, and they started using serious storylines and graphic violence in the same ways.</p>

      <p>Google&rsquo;s AlphaZero program is a machine that plays chess, and it has managed to quickly become the strongest chess AI in the world by implementing machine learning techniques. While existing chess AIs have mostly been massive dictionaries of moves that are put together by humans, AlphaZero learned chess entirely on its own with minimal human input.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the hardest part of creating an AI that solves problems like chess is finding some way to calculate if you&rsquo;re winning or not. If that were easy to do, the program could just look at all of its possible moves (which is not very many for a computer) and see which one would leave it winning by more. The trouble is that it&rsquo;s very hard to tell if you&rsquo;re winning. You might need to consider all possible outcomes many moves in advance, which quickly becomes too many to calculate.</p>

<p>Mobile games are generally much more simple than traditional video games, so they can&rsquo;t provide the same rich experiences as traditional video games. Instead, they engage their core users by providing a satisfying experience of winning, especially against other players. Since people often play mobile games in their spare time, money is used as a shortcut to win quickly and efficiently. The entire game&rsquo;s structure is built around creating an environment to support people who are willing to pay large amounts of money in order to win.</p>

      <p>I'm a supporter of LGBT rights. I'm generally not too vocal about it, but with recent events culminating in the Orlando mass shootings, I had to say something.</p>
<p>I've been thinking a lot about the LGBT rights movement recently. Hopefully this effort can be another step forward following the Civil Rights Movement, as we work towards equal rights and treatment for all.</p>
<p>The Civil Rights Act made it illegal to discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Setting religion aside for a moment, the rest are distinctions that generally lead to noticeable physical differences. The ease of identification is probably one factor that helped the prejudice spread so much, and led to institutional disenfranchisement as well as terrible acts of discrimination and violence.</p>

      <p>チームラボの猪子氏がTEDxFukuokaで紹介した、日本と西洋での空間認識の違いについての話がとてもおもしろかったので紹介。</p>
<p><a href="http://logmi.jp/23783" target="_blank">マリオはなぜ世界でヒットしたのか？　チームラボ・猪子氏が語る、日本的空間認識とクリエイティビティの関係性</a></p>
<p>プレゼンテーションの内容を省略すると、</p>
<p>西洋の空間認識だと、パースペクティブを意識する。
よって、絵の登場人物になりきると視点が変わって絵の全体を意識しなくなる。絵の全体の意識が変わる、と言う方が適切なのかもしれない。</p>
<p>日本の空間認識だと、レイヤーで物を見て、重ねて表現する。
絵の登場人物になりきっても、絵の認識が変わらず、絵の全体を意識し続ける。</p>
<p>これが、日本が産んだマリオやドラクエみたいなプラットフォーマーや、トップダウンRPGなどの表現を作ったゲームの原点で、アメリカではもっと登場人物の視点で遊ぶFPSなどが流行りやすい。</p>
<p>とのこと。</p>
<p>ハードのスペックで3Dの表現ができなかったことも大きい、と想像しつつも、とても興味深い話。</p>
<p>Oculus Rift 用に開発中の<a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/06/oculus-luckys-tale/" target="_blank">Lucky’s Tale</a>の話を思い出した。</p>
<p>Lucky&rsquo;s TaleはVR機能を活かした3Dのプラットフォーマーなのだが、自分が主人公になりきるわけではない。キャラクターの視点と自分の視点は完全に別で、自分が3Dの世界の中で、主人公の隣に居るという見せ方。</p>
<p>開発者曰く、たくさんの案をとにかく作りまくっているうちに偶然出来上がったものだったが、少し遊んでみると体験の斬新さに全員が驚いた、とのこと。</p>
<p>上の話に合わせると、VRなのでパースペクティブで入り込むのはほぼ必須として、それでもマリオのようにキャラと空間の全体の絵を意識し続けれるような、全く新しい形になっているような気がする。おそらく実際遊んでみないと体験を想像できないと思うので、リリースが楽しみだ。</p>

      <p>仕事でも、プライベートでも、自分の昔からの目標は「面白い」を創ること。
ゲームを創る職についているので、今回はゲームの話が中心となる。</p>
<h2 id="面白いとは">「面白い」とは？</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird">Flappy Bird</a>や<a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a>のようなゲームが見せてくれたように、
根本的な面白い要素さえあれば、どんなシンプルなゲームでも大ヒットする可能性がある。
むしろ、これらのゲームは最もシンプルであることが必須で、根本の面白さの邪魔をする要素がない、というのも成功の要因だと言える。</p>
<p><a href="http://asherv.com/threes/">Threes</a>の製作者は、凄まじい量のブレストと改善を行った上でゲームをリリースした。
その途中で、いずれ2048としてリリースされるゲームシステムを検討したが、彼らの思う「良いゲーム」の定義に当てはまらなく、ボツにされた。
2048のシステムだと、一つの角に寄せて操作すると簡単に高得点が出せるので、それが「正しい」遊び方になってしまう。
おそらく、彼らはゲームとしての深みを重視して、それがゲームの良さを損なうと考え、別のシステムを創った。</p>
<p>結果としては、ゲームの「良さ」を損なうと疑われた要素はゲームの「面白さ」につながり、単純な方のシステムを適用した2048が全世界で大ヒットした。
実際Threesのゲームとしてのクオリティーはかなり高く評価されていて、Threesを否定するわけではない。
ただ、いくら客観的に見てThreesが良いゲームであっても、「2048の方が面白い」と思った人の方が多かった。</p>
<h2 id="面白いを探す">「面白い」を探す</h2>
<p>残念なことに、「面白い」は捕えにくい。一生懸命探せば探すほど、見つからない。
それを見つけるにはとてもクリエイティブな思考が必要で、たまたま得た発想が案外、有益をもたらすことが多い。</p>
<p>自分が新しい物を創る時、なにが面白くなりそうかを考えることに必ずなる。
ただ、これがうまく行くとは限らず、面白い発想が出ない悪循環にもなり得る。</p>
<p>万人の受けを予想しようとすると、現在万人受けしている物を参考にせざるを得ない。
考え始める前から、すでに枠の中に入ってしまっているわけだ。
プロセスはおそらく以下のようになる：</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>人気がある物を見る</li>
<li>なぜそれが面白いかを分析する</li>
<li>その面白さを、新しい形で再現する</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>「新しい形」のところで近道をしている人がありふれたパクリゲームを作ることになるわけだが、
真面目に新しく考えようとしても、既存の物から思考がスタートしている時点で、創れる物の幅が狭くなってしまう。</p>
<h2 id="面白いを発見する">「面白い」を発見する</h2>
<p>プロセスはこうあるべきだ：</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>新しい発想を得る</li>
<li>それを面白くする方法を考える</li>
<li>その面白さに集中して、余計な要素を無くす</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>奇跡的に、<a href="http://pokemon.alexonsager.net">ポケモンフュージョン</a>はこれを果たしていると思う。
ある日その単純な発想が頭に浮かんで、そこに見つけた面白さはシンプルなサイトでも伝わる物だった。</p>
<p>新しい発想を得ることは簡単ではなく、自分ももっと簡単にする方法を探している。
一番大事なことは、自分が興味のあるものを推し進めることだと思う。
「興味深い」の先には必ず「面白い」があると考えていて、そこに行き着くためには自らの熱意が必要。</p>
<p>その先で「面白い」を見つけることができたら、多分それは自分しか見つけることが出来なかった新しい「面白い」であろう。</p>

      <p>From <a href="http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/san-francisco-dead-long-live-san-francisco">Gary Kamiya</a> in San Francisco Magazine, talking about the many factors and consequences of San Francisco&rsquo;s economic growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(I)f present trends continue, the city could soon become a moated citadel of info-money, accessible only to venture capitalists, Twitter engineers, and the creators of hookup apps.<br>
[&hellip;]<br>
This prospect worries me. As someone who loves San Francisco’s maverick tradition and its class and ethnic diversity (I celebrated both in a book I wrote last year called Cool Gray City of Love), I find the idea that my beloved town is on the verge of becoming another Manhattan—a picturesque but increasingly expensive, homogeneous, and sterile burg—distressing, to put it mildly.<br>
[&hellip;]<br>
And yet, the political, cultural, and class war that has erupted over what is happening to San Francisco—call it the Change—strikes me as wrongheaded to the point of surreality.<br>
[&hellip;]<br>
I’m all for rushing the barricades when there’s an enemy to fight and a battle that can be won. I’ve engaged in my share of such battles. But it’s time to reckon with reality: There is no enemy here. Or if there is, it’s an enemy that won’t be defeated. What has hit San Francisco in the last couple of years can be summed up in one word: capitalism. And that is a tsunami that no seawall can keep out.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been getting a few questions about the script used to generate the <a href="http://pokemon.alexonsager.net">Pokemon Fusion</a> sprites, so I thought I would write a quick blog post to describe the process.</p>
<p>The inspiration of the website was the idea that it should be possible to automate the process of combining pokemon sprites, and each image is automatically generated by a computer script. Some of the results are less impressive than others, but I think that it adds to the fun and makes it that much more satisfying when you come across ones that work really well.</p>

<li>allow a 2nd person&rsquo;s consciousness to then enter those memories and experience them firsthand.</li>

<p>They then use this machine to have someone enter the memory of a person present at a train bombing, so that he can find the culprit and stop the next crime.</p>

      <p>After the 3/11 earthquake, #prayforjapan was a hashtag used for people around the world to send messages of encouragement to Japan. <a href="http://prayforjapan.jp/">prayforjapan.jp</a> is a site that is collecting heartwarming tweets from Japanese users, as well as messages from outside the country.</p>
<p>I got emotional after reading just a few of these messages. The earthquake was a terrible tragedy, but amidst all of that I feel admiration for the spirit of the Japanese people. Messages like this show that people have really come together to help one another, and it give me great hope for the country’s recovery.</p>

      <p>I might even say that I didn’t grow up in any meaningful way before I started high school.</p>
<p>I’ve always felt like I have very limited memories of middle school and elementary school. The problem, as I realized recently, isn’t that I have few memories. Rather, it is that my memories don’t seem to include my thoughts – what I wondered, what I thought about, and how I felt about certain things. When probing my memories I get plenty of clear images, but I can’t help but feel like an observer; I can see my past-self doing things and reacting to events, but I have no idea what that child was thinking. I mean, I can guess. I’m sure I’d be pretty good at guessing, since I know the kid well, but it’s strange that this isn’t part of the memory.</p>

      <p>I recently saw Gogol Bordello perform live for the second time. The first was a year (two years?) ago in San Francisco, and it was the wildest, most exhilarating event I have ever attended. Many concerts have &ldquo;that one song,&rdquo; that brings the entire audience together in a fever of enthusiasm to focus entirely on the music and the performance. Gogol Bordello managed to maintain this state for the entire 2 hour show. The rush of being in a huge crowd of people screaming in unison and immersed in the moment, led by the gods of gypsy punk, was indescribable. But enough about last year.</p>

<p>While a Stanford undergrad, I began my online career with gleeful audacity. The Monday after Facebook Platform launched, my friend and I released Facebook&rsquo;s original Graffiti application. We were unexperienced and had no viral component, so we soon lost the battle to Mark Kantor et al.&rsquo;s version. But Graffiti gave us excitement and hunger. The following fall we enrolled in Stanford&rsquo;s course on Facebook applications, using the opportunity to develop Send Hotness. This time, we nailed the virality. A few advertising payouts later, we were the proud owners of two companies. Doped up on adrenaline, we loved every minute. I stepped down eventually once I remembered that I had schoolwork to do, but I felt sure that this was my path.</p>

      <p>Today I ate dinner alone. I think there is nothing wrong with that, but you just don’t see people alone in restaurants all that often (Aren’t you going to be bored? Do you want a magazine or something?). Eating meals, in most cultures everywhere, is regarded as a social activity. I would like to explore why, and have a few hypotheses.</p>
<p><strong>Everybody has to do it</strong>. Three times a day, nearly everybody will eat food at roughly the same time. People share this activity, and so it makes sense for that time to be designated for social interaction. If everybody had tea at 3, or went to the gym at 4, then those would just as strongly be considered a social activity.</p>

<p>You see, there is something special about lollipops. As far as your mouth is concerned, you could just as well be eating a normal hard candy. But the stick makes a world’s difference. You are proclaiming to the world, <em>&ldquo;I am enjoying a candy.&rdquo;</em> There is no way to be inconspicuous about eating a lollipop. You have committed to this act, and do so with no shame.</p>
