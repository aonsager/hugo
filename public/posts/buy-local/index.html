  <p>I look at reviews before buying things, and I prefer personal websites and youtube channels over large publications because I can get a feel for the person behind the opinions, and their preferences. I&rsquo;ve noticed though that reviews gravitate towards a certain subset of good, but mostly American brands. This is only a problem because I live in Japan, where limited availability and terrible exchange rates makes everything feel twice as expensive as they ought to be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently started leaning towards trying products made by Japanese companies instead, and have been very pleasantly surprised with the overall quality. Most recently when choosing my [[desk mat]], I ended up buying from both <a href="https://shop.minimaldesksetups.com/products/desk-pad?variant=47324556951745">Minimal Desk Setups</a> and from a Japanese company called <a href="https://amesoba.com">amesoba</a>. I knew nothing about this company, but their lineup was impressive and they presented a lot of care in their products. I&rsquo;m very pleased with the desk mat I got from them.</p>
<p>I still use mostly western products, but I think I&rsquo;ll make an effort to find Japanese alternatives when it comes time to replace items. Japan still has a bastion of creators who are passionate about their craft, and you can find really excellent products from companies that are not widely known.</p>
