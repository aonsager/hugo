  <h1>Becoming a parent introduced me to stress</h1>

  
  
  <time datetime="2025-01-20T00:00:00&#43;00:00">January 20, 2025</time>

  <p>I have always been a calm and happy person. Aggressively optimistic, even. I made it through the first 1/3 of my life without feeling much stress, only getting angry on rare occasions. Anger management, emotional therapy, mindfulness exercises, these were all things that I had no need for.</p>
<p>I thought that this was a personality trait, but now I realize that I was simply blessed with an easy life. It&rsquo;s not that I was particularly good at dealing with stress, I just didn&rsquo;t have much stress coming my way.</p>
<p>Well, parenting is not easy. It is demanding. uncontrollable, scary, and stressful. I love my kids dearly and would not want them to change for the world, and that seems to make it even harder. I want so badly to be the parent they deserve, to guide them with a gentle hand and encourage their every exploration.</p>
<p>But it is hard.</p>
<p>And I am feeling the stress that had nothing to do with me until now. I feel frustrated when things don&rsquo;t go the way I expected, I feel ashamed when I neglect opportunities to engage my kids, and I feel angry when situations get out of my control.</p>
<p>I have to tell myself to take a deep breath and count to ten. I have to spend time with myself to sort out my feelings and learn what my needs are. All of these techniques that I had always overlooked as having nothing to do with me, are now suddenly instructive and eye-opening.</p>
<p>In my head, I know that I am probably overestimating the impact that I have on my children&rsquo;s growth. They are their own people, and they will live their lives to their fullest. They will learn from and be influenced by so many more sources than just their father.</p>
<p>But I want to give them everything I can. I want to be a rock-solid, positive influence like my parents were for me. I want to teach them the names of flowers, and insects, and constellations, and construction trucks, and super-heroes, and inventors, and mountains, and countries, and exotic foods. I want to make things with them so that they can understand how things work, how they can take things apart and put them back together again. I want to show them that they are special, and that they have so many unique things to offer to the world.</p>
<p>But I am not that father yet. I&rsquo;ve learned how selfish and impatient I can be. I&rsquo;m new to this, too, so of course it will take a lot of time, effort, and patience.  I need to take things one step at a time, and also let myself recognize that I am already doing a fine job.</p>
<p>But now, I am stressed out.</p>
<p>But it will be worth it.</p>
