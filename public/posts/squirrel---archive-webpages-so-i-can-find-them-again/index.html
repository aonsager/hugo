<p>I <a href="https://github.com/aonsager/squirrel-archiver">created a thing</a> that lets me save webpage contents in a smart way. I know, there are a million bookmark managers and web archivers out there, but this one is for me.</p>
<h2 id="the-motivation">The Motivation</h2>
<p>From <a href="https://pinboard.in/about/">Pinboard</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you half-remember interesting things you saw online six months ago, but struggle to find them in a search engine?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, yes, a hundred times yes. This happens to me all the time. Searching my history doesn&rsquo;t work because usually the keywords I remember are not in the title. Google et al. aren&rsquo;t much help either.</p>
<p>I want a way to have the <em>contents</em> of the pages I visit be searchable, in a smart way.</p>
<!-- more -->
<h2 id="my-requirements">My Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="1-minimal-friction-to-saving-content">1. Minimal friction to saving content</h3>
<p>If I need to go through an entire workflow or remember some specific key combinations, I&rsquo;m probably not going to use it. I want this to become a subconscious action whenever I finish reading something interesting.</p>
<p>Pinboard&rsquo;s javascript bookmarklet is very good, but unfortunately I then need to manually add tags and a description. I mean, I don&rsquo;t have to, but the bookmark is significantly less useful if I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I used the <a href="https://obsidian.md/clipper">Obsidian Web Clipper</a> for a while, and it was actually very good. The article text is saved in a new note, and tags and summaries are extracted from the page&rsquo;s metadata <em>if they exist</em>. But, and I know this is a nitpick, it takes a few steps each time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the button</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;Add to Obsidian&rdquo;</li>
<li>Say &ldquo;Yes I want to allow this site to to open Obsidian&rdquo;</li>
<li>Obsidian opens automatically with the new note</li>
<li>Navigate back to the browser, to continue what I was doing</li>
</ol>
<p>Every time. It&rsquo;s friction.</p>
<h3 id="2-easy-to-run-a-text-search-across-the-full-text">2. Easy to run a text search across the full text</h3>
<p>Titles and URLs are not enough. I want to expose the full article text to search, too.</p>
<p>Pinboard again, only allows me to search titles + manual summaries + bookmarks. I can pay $39 a year to enable full text search, but that&rsquo;s kind of expensive and leads to the next point:</p>
<h3 id="3-not-expensive">3. Not expensive</h3>
<p>I mean, a couple of dollars a month isn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> much. But they add up. This seems like the kind of problem that I, a non-power user, should be able to solve pretty cheaply.</p>
<p>Tangentially, I also really liked the idea behind Browser Parrot, which seems to have been replaced by <a href="https://github.com/iansinnott/browser-gopher">Browser Gopher</a>. It automatically saves every page from your browser history, and can extract the full text.<br>
The problem with this was that it ended up using <em>lots</em> of CPU, and the archive took up a lot of space, too. I think that in practice, 90% of the pages I visit are not worth saving.</p>
<h3 id="other-things-that-arent-needed-but-might-be-nice">Other things that aren&rsquo;t needed but might be nice</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some kind of tagging system (minimum friction of course) so that I can link related information and re-discover old items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An accessible format to save the data. I prefer plain text to a database, because I can browse and open text files from Finder, or use them later for whatever I need.<br>
Would a database be more byte-efficient and make searching faster? Maybe. But since I&rsquo;m not going to be saving millions of files, it probably will not make much of a difference.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="based-on-the-above-my-solution">Based on the above, my solution</h2>
<h3 id="1-put-any-webpage-i-want-to-save-into-a-text-file">1. Put any webpage I want to save into a text file</h3>
<div class="callout">
<div class="title">Update 2025/02/14</div>
I wanted to use a folder in Safari bookmarks to save URLs since the OS already has handy hotkeys and utilities, but unfortunately editing the plist file by hand caused sync issues, so I gave up.
</div>
<p>I set up a Shortcut to grab Safari&rsquo;s URL and add it to a text file <code>urls.txt</code>, which lives on my iCloud drive.</p>
<h3 id="2-run-a-script-that-periodically-looks-at-urlstxt-and-processes-new-items">2. Run a script that periodically looks at urls.txt and processes new items</h3>
<p>Setting a cron task to run this script once per day is fine. The text file is wiped after each run, and URLs that failed for some reason are saved to a separate file.</p>
<h3 id="3-access-the-url-to-save-the-title-and-article-text">3. Access the URL to save the title and article text</h3>
<p>Python libraries can do this easily. There is a lot of optimization that could be done to check for errors and edge cases, but as a personal project I don&rsquo;t need it to be bullet-proof. Just a simple grab and dump.</p>
<h3 id="4-use-chatgpt-to-generate-tags-and-a-short-summary-automatically">4. Use ChatGPT to generate tags and a short summary automatically</h3>
<p>This sort of thing is what AI was born to do. Having an automatic tagging system is such a luxury, and doing it directly through the API is dirt-cheap.</p>
<h3 id="5-package-into-a-text-file-and-output-to-a-local-folder">5. Package into a text file, and output to a local folder</h3>
<p>Now I have a single folder on my hard drive that holds all of the articles that I thought were worth reading.</p>
<h3 id="6-open-the-folder-as-an-obsidian-vault">6. Open the folder as an Obsidian Vault</h3>
<p>Searching the article contents is very fast, and I can use graph view to explore tags. I can probably do a lot to make it more useful, but for now it&rsquo;s pretty.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2025/squirrel-graph.png" alt="Obsidian graph view. Black nodes are notes, green nodes are tags"></p>
<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>
<p>It also was super easy to set up an edge case for YouTube videos. Instead of grabbing the page body&rsquo;s text, it instead uses the YouTube API to grab transcripts from the video. This is turning out to be a great way in general to extract information from YouTube and make it accessible to me later.</p>
<h2 id="the-script">The Script</h2>
<p>Is on <a href="https://github.com/aonsager/squirrel-archiver">Github</a></p>
<p>My intention is not to promote this for wide use, but you can feel free to fork it if you think it might work for you.</p>
<h3 id="my-archive-now">My archive now</h3>
<p>I went through the bookmarks I had saved in various places and ran them all through this script. After pruning dead links, I had about 500 articles saved over the course of 17 years. My most used tags are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Environment</li>
<li>Development</li>
<li>AI</li>
<li>Community</li>
<li>Creativity</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
</ol>
<p>Sustainability and Environment were a surprise. I guess that when I read articles about those topics, I feel compelled to save them?</p>
