  <h1>Beautiful vs. Effective Prose</h1>

  
  
  <time datetime="2021-12-16T00:00:00&#43;00:00">December 16, 2021</time>

  <p>A long time ago, I fancied myself a writer and strove to write beautiful prose. I read a lot and borrowed from styles that I admired, but oftentimes my sentences ran on, and I relied on my thesaurus too heavily. But I enjoyed the process of writing and reached a familiarity with words that allowed me to simply let my thoughts flow through my fingers onto the page.</p>
<p>At university, I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style">The Elements of Style</a> and quickly became an advocate instead of lean, effective prose. I strove to convey my thoughts using fewer words. Composition took more effort as I scrutinized each phrase. I was happy with the results, and I felt a deliberate craftsmanship that seemed more pronounced than before.</p>
<p>Then, I moved to Asia and began communicating primarily with people for whom English wasn&rsquo;t their first language. I started using short, simple sentences that got straight to the point. If the purpose of writing is communication, then all that&rsquo;s really important is to tell the other person what they need to know, right? Saying things in a fancy way will only complicate things.</p>
<p>It was around this time that I first saw the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Simple English Wikipedia</a>, and my first thought was, &ldquo;Now this is the pinnacle of knowledge transfer. This is how you provide the most information to the most number of people as efficiently as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; nagged a deep and quiet part of my mind, &ldquo;that can&rsquo;t be the full story. Poetry and literature, sure, it&rsquo;s easy to set those aside and say maybe that it&rsquo;s an art form, it&rsquo;s writing for the sake of writing, and that&rsquo;s why the pursuit of beauty can occur. Normal, day-to-day writing is not the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about, say, Journalism? That&rsquo;s writing to share information, but when you recall the most esteemed journalists they aren&rsquo;t the ones who write like a press release. They are those who have perfected their craft, who can shape their words into a compelling picture to evoke emotional reactions in the reader. Isn&rsquo;t that what you should strive for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, of course. Beautiful or effective? You want a lot of both. And unless you&rsquo;re writing an instruction manual, sometimes prose needs to be beautiful to be effective. I haven&rsquo;t taken writing seriously in a very long time, so unfortunately my writing now is not much of either, but I suppose now is a fine time to start looking for my best voice again.</p>
