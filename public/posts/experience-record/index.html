  <p>From <a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/p/i-deleted-my-second-brain">Joan Westenberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PKM systems promise coherence, but they often deliver a kind of abstracted confusion. The more I wrote into my vault, the less I felt. A quote would spark an insight, I’d clip it, tag it, link it - and move on. But the insight was never lived. It was stored. Like food vacuum-sealed and never eaten, while any nutritional value slips away.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I first started using PKM tools, I believed I was solving a problem of forgetting. Later, I believed I was solving a problem of integration. Eventually, I realized I had created a new problem: deferral. The more my system grew, the more I deferred the work of thought to some future self who would sort, tag, distill, and extract the gold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of points made in Joan&rsquo;s piece here really resonated with me. I have never made any meaningful headway in deliberate note-taking, or knowledge management, or second-brain creation. Not for a lack of trying! There just seems to be something in my mind that resists this kind of rigor.</p>
<p>If some small scrap of information doesn&rsquo;t stick in my mind, maybe it&rsquo;s OK to forget it. Maybe recording everything is not the best way to engage with it.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m terrible at remembering to take photos. I just get so caught up in the moments that I don&rsquo;t think to record them. But honestly, I <em>prefer</em> just being able to experience my life for myself, rather than always keeping a phone between me and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>My son&rsquo;s kindergarten class put on a performance for parents in the spring. The parents were cautioned beforehand that in past years, adults were so busy photographing that nobody remembered to clap for the kids. I imagined being in the place of the kids, looking to see your parents&rsquo; faces and just seeing a sea of phones instead.</p>
<p>The kindergarten also hires a professional videographer and you can buy a DVD later. The prices are absurd, but it&rsquo;s worth it if I can keep my phone in my pocket and make sure my son can always see my face. Every time our eyes meet, he beams.</p>
