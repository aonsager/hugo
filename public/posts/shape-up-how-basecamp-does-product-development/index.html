  <h1>Shape Up - How Basecamp does Product Development</h1>

  <p><a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a> is an amazing new web-book by Basecamp that details the process they use to define, build, and ship their products. It has great insights, but I especially appreciated how many of the ideas presented just make a lot of sense. I often nodded along in agreement and recognized concepts that we share in our team. The framework is battle-tested and realistic, and there&rsquo;s a good chance I&rsquo;ll be able to integrate some new ideas into our existing workflow without having to reorganize how we think about everything to fit a new metaphor.</p>
<p>What I found the most impressive was how clearly they have defined the key ideas and concepts behind their process. Even if your team can find a groove and settle into a good way to work effectively, it takes a lot more effort to recognize why these things work and how they can be reproduced in different situations. Reading this document helped to solidify a lot of ideas I had encountered before but not fully appreciated.</p>
<p>The full document deserves a thorough read-through, but here is a summary of the main points for quick reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw ideas are shaped into a <strong>concept pitch</strong>, with implementation details left open for the team to work out.</li>
<li>Pitches are considered at a <strong>betting table</strong> and chosen for six-week work cycles.</li>
<li>Small teams of developers and designers will be given a shaped concept and six uninterrupted weeks to finish.</li>
<li>Work is broken up into <strong>scopes</strong> that incorporate front and back-end work. Scopes are finished roughly in sequence.</li>
<li>The status of scopes is displayed as being <strong>uphill</strong> (still containing unknowns) or <strong>downhill</strong> (solved and being executed)</li>
<li>The work must be shipped within the allotted time. Unfinished work won&rsquo;t get an extension</li>
<li>Meanwhile, new concepts are shaped in parallel. The next <strong>betting table</strong> is held during a two-week cooldown between cycles.</li>
</ul>
