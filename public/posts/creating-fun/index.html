  <h1>Creating Fun</h1>

  
  
  <time datetime="2014-06-25T23:28:00&#43;00:00">June 25, 2014</time>

  <p>My long-standing goal, in both work and personal life, is to create &ldquo;fun&rdquo;. I currently make games for a living, so I&rsquo;ll be focusing on games for this post.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-fun">What is Fun?</h2>
<p>Games like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird">Flappy Bird</a> and <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a> show that as long as you have one crucial element that provides fun, even the simplest of games can be a huge hit. And in fact, for games like these it is necessary that they be the simplest of games, with no other elements distracting from that core nugget of fun.</p>
<p>The makers of <a href="http://asherv.com/threes/">Threes</a> went through a tremendous amount of creative iteration before publishing their game. They considered the game system that eventually would become 2048, but decided that it didn&rsquo;t fit their criteria for what makes a game &ldquo;good&rdquo;. I would imagine that during the game design process they prioritized the game&rsquo;s strategic depth, such as the lack of a clear <em>correct</em> way to play. They nixed 2048 because it&rsquo;s relatively easy to score high if you stick to one corner, and they felt that this detracted from the game&rsquo;s potential.</p>
<p>As it turns out, those elements that they felt would make the game less <em>good</em> in fact ended up making the game more <em>fun</em>, and led to the huge success of 2048, which implements the simpler version. I&rsquo;m not arguing against the quality of Threes, which was widely acclaimed for good reason. My point is simply that more people found 2048 to be more fun.</p>
<h2 id="searching-for-fun">Searching for Fun</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, fun is elusive. The harder you look, the harder it is to find. You need an extremely creative mindset, and inspiration that is stumbled upon is often the most fruitful.</p>
<p>When I make a new thing, I will inevitably spend time imagining what might be fun. This doesn&rsquo;t always work, and tends to get me in a rut.</p>
<p>When you try to predict popular opinion, your inspiration comes from current popular opinion. You&rsquo;re in a box before you&rsquo;ve even begun. The process is something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>See what is popular</li>
<li>Analyze why it is fun</li>
<li>Replicate that funness in an original product</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>People cutting corners on the originality bit is what leads to the epidemic of copycat games, but even if you give it an honest shot you&rsquo;re still very limited in what the final product can be, because your thinking began within the confines of what already exists.</p>
<h2 id="discovering-fun">Discovering Fun</h2>
<p>This is what the process ought to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Have an original idea</li>
<li>Find a way to make it fun</li>
<li>Focus on the funness and remove unnecessary parts</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>By some brilliant stroke of luck, I think that <a href="http://pokemon.alexonsager.net">Pokemon Fusion</a> managed to accomplish this. It was an exceedingly simply idea that appeared in my head one day, and a no-fluff website was enough to convey the funness that I had found.</p>
<p>Having original ideas is hard, but I&rsquo;m trying to find ways to make it easier. I think the most important thing is to follow what interests you. The road to <em>interesting</em> continues onward to <em>fun</em>, but you need passion to follow the path. And if you reach the funness that awaits, you will likely have discovered a &ldquo;fun&rdquo; that only you could find.</p>
