  <p><em>Originally posted on the <a href="http://fbfund.com/facebook-and-non-profits-revolutionizing-with-samasource/">fbFund blog</a></em></p>
<p>While a Stanford undergrad, I began my online career with gleeful audacity. The Monday after Facebook Platform launched, my friend and I released Facebook&rsquo;s original Graffiti application. We were unexperienced and had no viral component, so we soon lost the battle to Mark Kantor et al.&rsquo;s version. But Graffiti gave us excitement and hunger. The following fall we enrolled in Stanford&rsquo;s course on Facebook applications, using the opportunity to develop Send Hotness. This time, we nailed the virality. A few advertising payouts later, we were the proud owners of two companies. Doped up on adrenaline, we loved every minute. I stepped down eventually once I remembered that I had schoolwork to do, but I felt sure that this was my path.</p>
<p>Fast forward to April 2009. Graduation is pending, and I have the thrilling chance to commit my waking hours to some product. As it turns out, I basically had one choice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re developing a real-time, web 2.0, social algorithm-based consumer-facing interface that will revolutionize what users do when they [blank]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many were great products, but I was saddened by those whose blanks were literal. They revolutionized where there was no value, turning a frivolous activity into a a well-designed and sexy frivolous activity. I needed more than that, and I looked for a way off of this path to inconsequence.</p>
<p>This is when I met Leila Chirayath Janah, the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.samasource.org/">Samasource</a>. Having been in operations for 6 months at the time, Samasource&rsquo;s mission was to bring dignified, computer-based work to women, youth, and refugees living in poverty. They recognized the tremendous untapped talent in impoverished countries and strove to bring prosperity by providing a sustainable livelihood. This is an idea that will change the world, and I was hooked from the start.</p>
<p>I now have the privilege of being Samasource&rsquo;s VP of Technology, and we have truly been blessed by being invited to participate in fbFund REV this summer. It&rsquo;s an unexpected meeting of my past and current passions, and it has been tremendously fruitful. The Facebook platform, as well as other social channels, have a huge potential to effect social change and support these initiatives.</p>
<p>Samasource&rsquo;s project this summer is to bring our services to the Facebook platform by allowing partners in rural Asia and sub-Saharan Africa to offer quality assurance and testing to application developers. I believe that Facebook can bring together resourceful entrepreneurs and skilled rural workers in a way that was previously unheard of. As an application developer you are working one-on-one with a real person from across the world. This is a very moving realization, as I found when first inviting our service partners to join the site. For these individuals, having a Facebook profile is itself a powerful first step. Many have little or no web presence, and this will be their first chance to build a legitimate online reputation. Imagine the excitement of becoming plugged into such a dynamic international network for the first time, seeing no limit to where your work can take you.</p>
<p>So as it turns out, I am now committing my waking hours to a great product. We are remodeling the means by which an individual can rise out of poverty. We are enabling people to make socially responsible decisions that will change a life forever. Samasource is revolutionizing by giving work.</p>
