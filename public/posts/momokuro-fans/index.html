  <h1>When a music festival was cancelled, idol fans supported the local community</h1>

  <p>Some uplifting <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/f3dc7027f17ec3d90e0da75d8f622e12452f471a">news from Japan</a>.</p>
<p>On April 13th in Shibata City of Niigata prefecture (Japan), the popular idol group <a href="https://www.momoclo.net">Momoiro Clover Z</a> had been planning a large music festival in cooperation with a large number of other artists, as well as local police, schools, and city government. However, on the day of festival the weather took a turn for the worse, and warnings were issued for strong winds, flash floods, and avalanches.</p>
<p>Although more than 10,000 people had arrived in the city already, the group made the decision to cancel the event and quickly organized an online broadcast of the artists&rsquo; musical performances in its place.</p>
<p>Among this, the group&rsquo;s fans have received wide attention for their excellent reaction to the bad news. Making endless reassurances online that &ldquo;the group made the correct decision&rdquo; and that &ldquo;safety is more important than anything,&rdquo; they then turned their attention to the impact this would have on the local community and businesses. Fans called upon each other to buy food prepared at  food stands to prevent excess waste, and to spend money at local businesses before returning home to support the community as much as possible.</p>
<p>There was no backlash, and no hard feelings. Just praise and compassion from everyone involved.</p>
