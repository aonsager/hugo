  <h1>Comments are back</h1>

  
  
  <time datetime="2024-11-27T00:00:00&#43;00:00">November 27, 2024</time>

  <p>This site has gone through many forms, and comments have come and gone. Now they are back, made possible by <a href="https://github.com/souramoo/commentoplusplus">commento++</a>. <a href="https://commento.io">Commento</a> was popular and on my radar for a while, but the original repository has been dead for a while. Commento++ is a fork that has been dead for&hellip; a little bit less of a while. But it has a few improvements from the original, and as long as it&rsquo;s stable I don&rsquo;t care so much.</p>
<p>But the better question is not <em>how</em>, but <em>why have comments</em>? (Or why not to?)</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have comments for a long time, because I decided that this blog was a place where I didn&rsquo;t care what other people said. It was a space for me to write and save things, just for myself. That&rsquo;s fine, too.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about what it means for me to write on this blog, espeically in the context of generative AI getting so good at replacing mediocre writers. Paul Graham&rsquo;s post <a href="https://paulgraham.com/writes.html">Writes and Write-Nots</a> resonated with me. The ability to write well is equivalent to the ability to think well. By continuing to write, on my own, I hope I can keep up my ability to think well.</p>
<p>And in many contexts, writing is also the ability to turn your thoughts into words and share them with other people. It is the ability to communicate. Writing in a personal journal might be good for my thinking, but I want to focus on my communication too. So, comments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write articles on this blog with the intent of communciating my thoughts to my readers, few as they are. And since communication is a two-way street, I wanted some kind of commenting system to get feedback and discourse. So I hope you find my posts here engaging, and would be very happy if you left me a comment, too.</p>
