      <description>&lt;p&gt;I initially chose &lt;a href=&#34;https://coolify.io/&#34;&gt;Coolify&lt;/a&gt; as a self-hosted alternative to Heroku when it got too expensive. Coolify makes a lot of things very easy, but I ended up having to dig in to the details and learn a lot to fix things that didn&amp;rsquo;t work. Now that I have learned a fair bit about server management, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that I may no longer need Coolify&amp;rsquo;s hand-holding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;venturing-into-self-hosting&#34;&gt;Venturing into self-hosting&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I knew next to nothing about Linux servers, Docker, reverse proxies, and the like. I had used Heroku for a long time, but its base price became restrictively expensive considering how small each of my little projects was, so I started looking for a service that could ease me into self-hosting my apps on a VPS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
