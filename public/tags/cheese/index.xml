      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time I thought I didn&amp;rsquo;t like carbonara because the few I tried were too creamy and eggy. Recently I gave it another try because the picture in the menu looked delicious. It was excellent, and I decided I wanted to learn how to make it myself. I needed some practice before I felt comfortable with the timings, but overall it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty simple recipe that wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard to learn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
