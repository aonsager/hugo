      <title>Wag Buys Shares Back from SoftBank</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wag was looking to raise $75 million. It went to SoftBank and was like &amp;ldquo;will you give us $75 million?&amp;rdquo; SoftBank was like &amp;ldquo;no haha we’ll give you $300 million,&amp;rdquo; because that is SoftBank’s whole thing, it loves to give startups vastly more money than they want or need. And so Wag took the money. And then like a year and a half later Wag will get rid of SoftBank by giving back, I don’t know, but I am going to say some number less than $225 million (&amp;ldquo;well below&amp;rdquo; the valuation at which it invested). Wag got the $75 million it needed for free.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Five Steps to an Effective Tech Team</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently experienced two of the most informative and useful meetings of my life. Lloyd Taylor, the former VP of Technical Operations at LinkedIn, and Olana Khan, the former COO of Kiva, graciously donated their time to speak to us about how to organize our technology goals. We had been in the process of formalizing our thoughts for an upcoming board meeting, but their expert feedback allowed us to cement in some much-needed structure. In addition, we also were given invaluable advice about how to lead an effective technology team in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hooray! Along with 18 companies and one other non-profit, &lt;strong&gt;Samasource was chosen to participate in fbFund’s incubator program this summer&lt;/strong&gt;. Check out the full list of winners on &lt;a href=&#34;http://venturebeat.com/2009/05/28/fbfund-17-companies-and-2-nonprofits-win-head-to-palo-alto/&#34;&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.insidefacebook.com/2009/05/28/facebook-announces-19-2009-fbfund-winners/&#34;&gt;InsideFacebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What this means is that we’ll have Palo Alto office space, lots of media attention, an official Facebook seal of approval, and possibly free lunches &lt;em&gt;/crossfingers&lt;/em&gt;. The catch?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to the way fbFund is structured, the non-profit startups cannot receive funding (&lt;a href=&#34;http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;amp;story=249&#34;&gt;Facebook dev blog&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
