      <title>Wag Buys Shares Back from SoftBank</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wag was looking to raise $75 million. It went to SoftBank and was like &amp;ldquo;will you give us $75 million?&amp;rdquo; SoftBank was like &amp;ldquo;no haha we’ll give you $300 million,&amp;rdquo; because that is SoftBank’s whole thing, it loves to give startups vastly more money than they want or need. And so Wag took the money. And then like a year and a half later Wag will get rid of SoftBank by giving back, I don’t know, but I am going to say some number less than $225 million (&amp;ldquo;well below&amp;rdquo; the valuation at which it invested). Wag got the $75 million it needed for free.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The First Image of a Black Hole</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/blackhole.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Credit: Event Horizon Telescope collaboration et al.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, scientists have captured &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=298276&#34;&gt;an image of a black hole&lt;/a&gt;. The black hole chosen is a supermassive black hole at the center of the Messier 87 galaxy, 55 million light-years away from Earth. This is huge news, since before this we only had theoretical proofs of black holes with no direct evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A black hole technically doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like anything since it emits no light, so I understand this to be a capture of light that came very close to the black hole. It appears in a very distinct way that confirms the presence of a black hole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Censoring Chinese Scammers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Q: What do you do when you&amp;rsquo;re being scammed by a Chinese scam artist?&#xA;A: Use their country&amp;rsquo;s internet censorship against them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LINE, the hugely popular Japanese messaging app, has been seeing a recent surge in scamming activity. In the most common scenario, the scam artist will gain access to a user&amp;rsquo;s account and message their friends, asking them to purchase online gift cards and send the serial number. Many people were targeted by this scam, and it received some mainstream media attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mattsgifs.com/post/73774946424&#34;&gt;During an E! interview at a red carpet ceremony&lt;/a&gt;, the camera operator takes a sweeping toe-to-head shot of Cate Blanchett, when she crouches down to ask, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you do that to the guys?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; The internet explodes with opinion, and more fuel is added to the increasing fight against the objectification of women in media.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, the camera operator was just doing their job. Red carpet ceremonies are events focused on fashion, and Cate Blanchett was wearing a very nice gown that should be seen in its entirety. No, most male guests would not have received the same treatment, because most male guests would be wearing suits or tuxedos and everybody knows what black pants look like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A chilling story told by a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay. I hope that someday we&amp;rsquo;ll look back and wonder how anything like this could have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been detained at Guantánamo for 11 years and three months. I have never been charged with any crime. I have never received a trial.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The situation is desperate now. All of the detainees here are suffering deeply. At least 40 people here are on a hunger strike. People are fainting with exhaustion every day. I have vomited blood.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And there is no end in sight to our imprisonment. Denying ourselves food and risking death every day is the choice we have made.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I just hope that because of the pain we are suffering, the eyes of the world will once again look to Guantánamo before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;#OnionOrActualHeadline&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The announcement from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) did not indicate a new scheduled time for a missile test, saying only that it was “working with Windows 8 support to resolve the issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A source close to the North Korean regime reported that Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un is furious about the Windows 8 problems and is considering a number of options, including declaring war on Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
