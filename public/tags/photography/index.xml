      <title>Photos of Japan that haven&#39;t changed in 150 years</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was pointed to an &lt;a href=&#34;https://cosmographia.substack.com/p/photographs-of-old-japan&#34;&gt;article on Cosmographia&lt;/a&gt; which in turn shared &lt;a href=&#34;https://sova.si.edu/record/fsa.a1999.35?s=0&amp;amp;n=10&amp;amp;t=C&amp;amp;q=japan&amp;amp;i=1&#34;&gt;an archive of photos taken in 19th century Japan&lt;/a&gt;. These are amazing photos, but what struck me was how &lt;em&gt;familiar&lt;/em&gt; some of them felt. Photos taken from 150 years ago should feel like looking into another world, but some of these scenes, the architecture, are still very present today. It makes it clear how cultural artifacts are so remarkably well-preserved here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Photo Composition Challenge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a mediocre photographer at best, but of course I want to improve. When I saw that &lt;a href=&#34;https://social.lol/@hiro&#34;&gt;@hiro&lt;/a&gt; was putting together 5-week challenge to experiment with various compositional techniques and share our photos, I had to join.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have fancy gear, or a lot of time to go hunting for photos, so almost all of my shots were scenes from my daily life, taken with an iPhone. I realized pretty quickly though, that being deliberate about composition gave a new perspective on even familiar scenes, and I was surprised at compelling some of the photos turned out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Music of the City - an Art Project Idea</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/music-of-the-city---an-art-project-idea/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had an idea for a fun art project in my head for many years now, and I don&amp;rsquo;t see myself going through with it any time soon, so I&amp;rsquo;ll compromise by just writing about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to photograph people (with permission) who are wearing headphones in the city. Their photo will be shown along with the song they happened to be listening to. It would be interesting to see if a viewer would see any correlation between a person&amp;rsquo;s visual appearance and their taste in music. The prompt &amp;ldquo;What song was playing right now&amp;rdquo; is much more interesting than &amp;ldquo;What is your favorite music,&amp;rdquo; and some people might think that I caught them at just the wrong time, making things more fun for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The First Image of a Black Hole</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/blackhole.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Credit: Event Horizon Telescope collaboration et al.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, scientists have captured &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=298276&#34;&gt;an image of a black hole&lt;/a&gt;. The black hole chosen is a supermassive black hole at the center of the Messier 87 galaxy, 55 million light-years away from Earth. This is huge news, since before this we only had theoretical proofs of black holes with no direct evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A black hole technically doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like anything since it emits no light, so I understand this to be a capture of light that came very close to the black hole. It appears in a very distinct way that confirms the presence of a black hole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/removebg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image: Remove.bg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.remove.bg/&#34;&gt;Remove.bg&lt;/a&gt; is a great service that makes it easy for anyone to remove the background of a photo. You can use it with small images for free, and pricing for HD photos seems very fair: you can pay $2 per image, or get a subscription starting at $9 per month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
