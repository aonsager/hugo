      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazingly imaginative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Oskar Schell, a young boy who is on a quest around New York City, attempting to solve a mystery left in the wake of his father’s death in the 9/11 attacks. The story is told in the form of narratives, letters, and journal entries from the perspective of three individuals, and their interwoven stories are revealed expertly in parallel. The book works as a scrapbook, with the reader discovering elements from the story appearing on the pages, as though they had been pasted in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
