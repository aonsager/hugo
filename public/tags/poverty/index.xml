      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three Cups of Tea&lt;/em&gt; is the most inspiring book I have ever read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is the true story following Greg Mortenson, a mountaineer who attempts to climb K2. On his way down, he stumbles into a tiny village in Pakistan and vows to return one day to build a school for the children there. He is successful, and is urged by others to continue building schools for underprivileged children across Pakistan. His story is remarkable, and the amount of impact he has managed to bring as one man with audacious goals is astounding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
