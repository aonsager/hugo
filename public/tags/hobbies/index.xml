      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I’m having fun with a hobby, nothing kills my motivation faster than learning about a better, more efficient way I could be doing things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was playing Fantasy Life i – chopping trees, making boots, fishing fish, and just generally having a grand time. It felt like alchemy skills were taking longer than the rest to level up, so i checked a wiki to see if i was missing something. Big mistake. What i learned is that, if i haven’t created 4 sunglasses with EXP boost buffs and then started crafting 10 thousand health potions to power level, I’m wasting my time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
