      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just using iCloud sync has been pretty solid in my experience. I have two Macs and one iPhone that share a single vault, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had no major issues&amp;hellip; except for one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the entire Obsidian folder lives inside of iCloud, the &lt;code&gt;.obsidian&lt;/code&gt; settings folder is also synced. Usually a good thing, except that the multi-pane view I have setup for desktop keeps getting pushed onto mobile. Because the panes all become tiny, and because Obsidian reverts to this view every time I use the app on desktop again, Obsidian basically became unusable on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
