      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a mediocre photographer at best, but of course I want to improve. When I saw that &lt;a href=&#34;https://social.lol/@hiro&#34;&gt;@hiro&lt;/a&gt; was putting together 5-week challenge to experiment with various compositional techniques and share our photos, I had to join.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have fancy gear, or a lot of time to go hunting for photos, so almost all of my shots were scenes from my daily life, taken with an iPhone. I realized pretty quickly though, that being deliberate about composition gave a new perspective on even familiar scenes, and I was surprised at compelling some of the photos turned out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a really excellent take on minesweeper. Spaces can contain monsters of various strength, and you need to spend HP to defeat them. By collecting EXP and hearts to level up and heal yourself, the goal is to become strong enough to slay the dragon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It took me a few tries to get a handle on the strategy, but this is super fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
