      <title>Facebook Is No Longer a Communication Platform</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started using Facebook in 2005, it was exclusive to college students and was by far the best way to communicate with my classmates. It was the first time I could learn what my friends were up to without asking each one individually. Everything I wanted to know about my friends was in one easily accessible place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All recent updates were shown as one long list, but Facebook eventually introduced the News Feed. This was an effort to filter everyone&amp;rsquo;s updates to show just the most important ones. Facebook made educated guesses about whose updates were most important to you and hid the ones you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t care about. I think they also kept an option to see all updates in chronological order if you didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Relationship Test - Dataclysm</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My team and I wrote an app that will apply findings from a recent research paper to your Facebook graph. The app won’t post to your wall but it will show you both the shape of your friend network and which of your friends are most mathematically important to your life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking at a metric like the number of friends you have in common, this algorithm takes it a step further. It looks at how well connected your mutual friends are with each other, and suggests that having more diverse mutual friends indicates a stronger, more important relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Facebook and Non-Profits: Revolutionizing with Samasource</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fbfund.com/facebook-and-non-profits-revolutionizing-with-samasource/&#34;&gt;fbFund blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While a Stanford undergrad, I began my online career with gleeful audacity. The Monday after Facebook Platform launched, my friend and I released Facebook&amp;rsquo;s original Graffiti application. We were unexperienced and had no viral component, so we soon lost the battle to Mark Kantor et al.&amp;rsquo;s version. But Graffiti gave us excitement and hunger. The following fall we enrolled in Stanford&amp;rsquo;s course on Facebook applications, using the opportunity to develop Send Hotness. This time, we nailed the virality. A few advertising payouts later, we were the proud owners of two companies. Doped up on adrenaline, we loved every minute. I stepped down eventually once I remembered that I had schoolwork to do, but I felt sure that this was my path.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hooray! Along with 18 companies and one other non-profit, &lt;strong&gt;Samasource was chosen to participate in fbFund’s incubator program this summer&lt;/strong&gt;. Check out the full list of winners on &lt;a href=&#34;http://venturebeat.com/2009/05/28/fbfund-17-companies-and-2-nonprofits-win-head-to-palo-alto/&#34;&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.insidefacebook.com/2009/05/28/facebook-announces-19-2009-fbfund-winners/&#34;&gt;InsideFacebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What this means is that we’ll have Palo Alto office space, lots of media attention, an official Facebook seal of approval, and possibly free lunches &lt;em&gt;/crossfingers&lt;/em&gt;. The catch?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to the way fbFund is structured, the non-profit startups cannot receive funding (&lt;a href=&#34;http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;amp;story=249&#34;&gt;Facebook dev blog&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
