      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking back on the media I consumed in 2025, this is a list of just my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;-games&#34;&gt;🎮️ Games&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;dragon-quest-v&#34;&gt;Dragon Quest V&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was always a Nintendo kid, and have played very few &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; games. I&amp;rsquo;d heard that is one of the best, and I finally grabbed the iOS port this year. Among other things, I was really impressed by the clever usage of game mechanics to tell story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Father&#39;s Bookshelf</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve avoided collecting too much stuff. I buy Kindle versions of books whenever possible, but there is a small shelf for the few books I have carried around with me over the years. My son, who is not quite two years old, will sometimes rummage through my books and leave them in a heap once he realizes there are no pictures, but it made me remember what my own father&amp;rsquo;s bookshelf was like for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
