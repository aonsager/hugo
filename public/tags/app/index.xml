      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a great implementation of an extremely minimal whiteboard app. There is no UI, and you can click to add text or click+drag to add boxes and lines. Zoom options in your browser will change the size, and you can save the HTML if you want to keep a copy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably not enough for work meetings, but I thought it was a great, fun product.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/removebg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image: Remove.bg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.remove.bg/&#34;&gt;Remove.bg&lt;/a&gt; is a great service that makes it easy for anyone to remove the background of a photo. You can use it with small images for free, and pricing for HD photos seems very fair: you can pay $2 per image, or get a subscription starting at $9 per month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mobile games can make a crazy amount of money. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_%26_Dragons&#34;&gt;Puzzles and Dragons&lt;/a&gt; at its peak was said to be earning &lt;em&gt;$100 million per month&lt;/em&gt;! Why do people spend so much?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mobile games are generally much more simple than traditional video games, so they can&amp;rsquo;t provide the same rich experiences as traditional video games. Instead, they engage their core users by providing a satisfying experience of winning, especially against other players. Since people often play mobile games in their spare time, money is used as a shortcut to win quickly and efficiently. The entire game&amp;rsquo;s structure is built around creating an environment to support people who are willing to pay large amounts of money in order to win.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Censoring Chinese Scammers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Q: What do you do when you&amp;rsquo;re being scammed by a Chinese scam artist?&#xA;A: Use their country&amp;rsquo;s internet censorship against them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LINE, the hugely popular Japanese messaging app, has been seeing a recent surge in scamming activity. In the most common scenario, the scam artist will gain access to a user&amp;rsquo;s account and message their friends, asking them to purchase online gift cards and send the serial number. Many people were targeted by this scam, and it received some mainstream media attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
