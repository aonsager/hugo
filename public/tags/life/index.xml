      <title>To experience, rather than record</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joanwestenberg.com/p/i-deleted-my-second-brain&#34;&gt;Joan Westenberg&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PKM systems promise coherence, but they often deliver a kind of abstracted confusion. The more I wrote into my vault, the less I felt. A quote would spark an insight, I’d clip it, tag it, link it - and move on. But the insight was never lived. It was stored. Like food vacuum-sealed and never eaten, while any nutritional value slips away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first started using PKM tools, I believed I was solving a problem of forgetting. Later, I believed I was solving a problem of integration. Eventually, I realized I had created a new problem: deferral. The more my system grew, the more I deferred the work of thought to some future self who would sort, tag, distill, and extract the gold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sorry the Elevator is Crowded</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The elevator in our office building has a small LCD panel that shows information like the current floor, but when the total weight of passengers crosses a certain threshold it also adds a short note: &amp;ldquo;Sorry the elevator is crowded&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It struck me – of all possible features for an elevator display, how did they decide that they needed this one? It has no impact on the elevator&amp;rsquo;s function of moving people vertically. And a crowded elevator is not the elevator&amp;rsquo;s fault (although this is most likely just an example of Japan&amp;rsquo;s self-deprecating approach to hospitality). So why was this message deemed necessary?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;things-that-changed&#34;&gt;Things that changed&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have more time in the morning to do things around the house instead of commuting&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remote meetings are a little harder than in-person meetings&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I write daily reports about my work progress, equally to show my teammates that I’m staying on track, and to keep myself on track&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We watch the news a lot more&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don’t wear socks&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pushing my social life online has lead to me talking to friends more than before&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;things-that-didnt-change&#34;&gt;Things that didn’t change&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Waking up in the morning is hard&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Work hours are mostly the same, or a little longer from the lack of a commute&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is still a lot of work to do and I am busy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I still shave and brush my teeth and shower&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I get dressed in the morning&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We get groceries delivered once a week&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The world is stressful, but being able to stay at home is a blessing so total stress balances out&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The dog doesn’t seem to care that I’m around&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Spaghetti Carbonara</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time I thought I didn&amp;rsquo;t like carbonara because the few I tried were too creamy and eggy. Recently I gave it another try because the picture in the menu looked delicious. It was excellent, and I decided I wanted to learn how to make it myself. I needed some practice before I felt comfortable with the timings, but overall it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty simple recipe that wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard to learn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Cook Popcorn in a Pan</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/how-to-cook-popcorn-in-a-pan/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/how-to-cook-popcorn-in-a-pan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best way to cook popcorn in a pan. The secret is to heat up the kernels evenly in hot oil first, before heating them over a flame to pop them quickly all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Coat the bottom of a pan with a small amount of oil and place over medium heat.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Put three popcorn kernels in the pan and wait for all three to pop.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Put the rest of the kernels in the pan, cover with a lid, and &lt;strong&gt;remove from the heat&lt;/strong&gt; for 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This heats the kernels evenly, getting them all ready to pop together.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Return the pan to the heat, where the popcorn should start popping right away.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It helps to keep the lid ajar and shake the pan occasionally to keep the popcorn dry.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once the popping slows to a few seconds between pops, pour the popcorn into a bowl.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add salt to taste.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/popcorn.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo by Keegan Evans from Pexels&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Because of her dissociative identity disorder, I was a stranger in the eyes of the woman I loved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beautifully written, and a reminder that something like 50 First Dates is actually a terrifying situation&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Be Polite</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/links/how-to-be-polite/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/links/how-to-be-polite/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t notice I’m polite, which is sort of the point. I don’t look polite. I am big and droopy and need a haircut. No soul would associate me with watercress sandwiches. Still, every year or so someone takes me aside and says, you actually are weirdly polite, aren’t you? And I always thrill. They noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Politeness buys you time. It leaves doors open. I’ve met so many people whom, if I had trusted my first impressions, I would never have wanted to meet again. And yet — many of them are now great friends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Grew Up in High School</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/i-grew-up-in-high-school/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I might even say that I didn’t grow up in any meaningful way before I started high school.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always felt like I have very limited memories of middle school and elementary school. The problem, as I realized recently, isn’t that I have few memories. Rather, it is that my memories don’t seem to include my thoughts – what I wondered, what I thought about, and how I felt about certain things. When probing my memories I get plenty of clear images, but I can’t help but feel like an observer; I can see my past-self doing things and reacting to events, but I have no idea what that child was thinking. I mean, I can guess. I’m sure I’d be pretty good at guessing, since I know the kid well, but it’s strange that this isn’t part of the memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Meals as a Social Activity</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/meals-as-a-social-activity/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/meals-as-a-social-activity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I ate dinner alone. I think there is nothing wrong with that, but you just don’t see people alone in restaurants all that often (Aren’t you going to be bored? Do you want a magazine or something?). Eating meals, in most cultures everywhere, is regarded as a social activity. I would like to explore why, and have a few hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everybody has to do it&lt;/strong&gt;. Three times a day, nearly everybody will eat food at roughly the same time. People share this activity, and so it makes sense for that time to be designated for social interaction. If everybody had tea at 3, or went to the gym at 4, then those would just as strongly be considered a social activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is that a Cigarette or a Lollipop?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/is-that-a-cigarette-or-a-lollipop/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a girl at a bus stop who appeared to have a cigarette in her mouth. &amp;ldquo;Yuck,&amp;rdquo; I thought. Then, I realized it was a lollipop. I immediately wanted to become her friend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You see, there is something special about lollipops. As far as your mouth is concerned, you could just as well be eating a normal hard candy. But the stick makes a world’s difference. You are proclaiming to the world, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am enjoying a candy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; There is no way to be inconspicuous about eating a lollipop. You have committed to this act, and do so with no shame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just ordered Strunk &amp;amp; White&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Elements of Style,&amp;rdquo; 50th anniversary edition. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the book yet, but the purchase inspired me to pay more attention to writing. Hopefully this can be someplace where I can practice writing, incorporating new ideas and polishing my prose. No high hopes yet, as I don&amp;rsquo;t often continue such things for long, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was at a restaurant last night and saw a couple having dinner together. At a few points, the guy was texting on his phone and the girl was looking really bored. Boo on him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then once he finished he left his phone sitting open on the table. I guess he was expecting replies? Maybe that sort of thing is commonplace now, but I still think it&amp;rsquo;s rude.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>
