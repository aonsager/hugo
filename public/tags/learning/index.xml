      <title>The importance of stupidity in scientific research</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.stanford.edu/~fukamit/schwartz-2008.pdf&#34;&gt;Martin A. Schwartz&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. Focusing on important questions puts us in the awkward position of being ignorant. One of the beautiful things about science is that it allows us to bumble along, getting it wrong time after time, and feel perfectly fine as long as we learn something each time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a constant pressure to be &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo;, but there are definitely situations where that&amp;rsquo;s impossible. Sometimes, being wrong is correct. It&amp;rsquo;s getting harder and harder to allow ourselves to enjoy bumbling and exploring, but it is so important.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My AI manifesto</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my personal manifesto for how I will and will not use generative AI. I believe it can be an extremely useful tool in certain situations, but can also have many negative repurcussions if used incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-use-to-expand-my-abilities-not-as-a-crutch&#34;&gt;1: Use to expand my abilities, not as a crutch.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-teach-me-new-things&#34;&gt;A: Teach me new things&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a coding assistant, AI can quickly show me the correct syntax. It can suggest implementations, and teach me how to implement new functions. These are extremely useful, and help me to be exponentionally more productive as a hobby developer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mental Training, and Learning to Swim</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my last year at university, I decided to learn to swim. I was reasonably confident in my ability to stay afloat in deep water and not die, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t what you could call swimming. Luckily, two of my close friends were excellent swimmers and they agreed to work with me in the mornings before class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I did take swimming lessons on and off for a few years when I was a kid, but apparently I retained nothing from those classes. Maybe I was just a terrible swimmer the entire time? Possibly related, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/i-grew-up-in-high-school&#34;&gt;I have very few memories from my elementary and middle school years&lt;/a&gt;, so I have a suspicion that I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a whole lot of thinking when I was a kid. In any case, I was essentially a total beginner to swimming when we started. I knew that you kicked your legs and paddled with your arms to go forward, but that was about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
