      <description>&lt;p&gt;A distinguished actor appeared on TV and talked about their love for juggling. They had taken lessons at various times and always sets aside time to practice because they enjoy it so much. They then recounted how they recently met their juggling teacher of ~10 years past, displayed their current juggling skills, and was met with astonishment at how &lt;em&gt;they had not improved one bit in all that time!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a funny story, but what struck me was just how &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; it was that juggling was a constant source of enjoyment for this person &lt;em&gt;despite apparently being no good at it&lt;/em&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s a hard thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
