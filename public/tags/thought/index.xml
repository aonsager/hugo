      <title>Meals as a Social Activity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I ate dinner alone. I think there is nothing wrong with that, but you just don’t see people alone in restaurants all that often (Aren’t you going to be bored? Do you want a magazine or something?). Eating meals, in most cultures everywhere, is regarded as a social activity. I would like to explore why, and have a few hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everybody has to do it&lt;/strong&gt;. Three times a day, nearly everybody will eat food at roughly the same time. People share this activity, and so it makes sense for that time to be designated for social interaction. If everybody had tea at 3, or went to the gym at 4, then those would just as strongly be considered a social activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is that a Cigarette or a Lollipop?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a girl at a bus stop who appeared to have a cigarette in her mouth. &amp;ldquo;Yuck,&amp;rdquo; I thought. Then, I realized it was a lollipop. I immediately wanted to become her friend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You see, there is something special about lollipops. As far as your mouth is concerned, you could just as well be eating a normal hard candy. But the stick makes a world’s difference. You are proclaiming to the world, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am enjoying a candy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; There is no way to be inconspicuous about eating a lollipop. You have committed to this act, and do so with no shame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
