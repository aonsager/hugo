      <description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in the 90s, and back then video games were made for kids. Toys were for kids, and video games were just the newest, most exciting toys around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as my generation grew up, we never really stopped playing games. As we became adults, the game companies kept making games for us, and games shifted to targeting an older audience. It makes sense that these would be successful since adults have more money to spend on games than kids do. Video games became a form of entertainment just like movies, and they started using serious storylines and graphic violence in the same ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The program is given a set of inputs from a human playing the game, and analyzes the RAM to define success in the game. It then plays the game with no knowledge of the rules, and works incredibly well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
