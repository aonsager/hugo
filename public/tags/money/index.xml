      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wag was looking to raise $75 million. It went to SoftBank and was like &amp;ldquo;will you give us $75 million?&amp;rdquo; SoftBank was like &amp;ldquo;no haha we’ll give you $300 million,&amp;rdquo; because that is SoftBank’s whole thing, it loves to give startups vastly more money than they want or need. And so Wag took the money. And then like a year and a half later Wag will get rid of SoftBank by giving back, I don’t know, but I am going to say some number less than $225 million (&amp;ldquo;well below&amp;rdquo; the valuation at which it invested). Wag got the $75 million it needed for free.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
