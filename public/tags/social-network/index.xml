      <title>Facebook Is No Longer a Communication Platform</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started using Facebook in 2005, it was exclusive to college students and was by far the best way to communicate with my classmates. It was the first time I could learn what my friends were up to without asking each one individually. Everything I wanted to know about my friends was in one easily accessible place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All recent updates were shown as one long list, but Facebook eventually introduced the News Feed. This was an effort to filter everyone&amp;rsquo;s updates to show just the most important ones. Facebook made educated guesses about whose updates were most important to you and hid the ones you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t care about. I think they also kept an option to see all updates in chronological order if you didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My team and I wrote an app that will apply findings from a recent research paper to your Facebook graph. The app won’t post to your wall but it will show you both the shape of your friend network and which of your friends are most mathematically important to your life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking at a metric like the number of friends you have in common, this algorithm takes it a step further. It looks at how well connected your mutual friends are with each other, and suggests that having more diverse mutual friends indicates a stronger, more important relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, May 5th was Gravity Summit&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Social Media Marketing for Business&amp;rdquo; at Stanford. I&amp;rsquo;ve known Rodney Rumford since Joachim and I made Graffiti for Facebook, and he was kind enough to save me a spot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The focus of the talks was very much aimed towards large businesses; presentations were given by such notable people as Bob Pearson of Dell, Inc. and Charles Miller from DIRECTV. That said, it seemed there were plenty of small business owners attending, and many of the points were generalizable. The main idea is:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
