      <description>&lt;p&gt;The elevator in our office building has a small LCD panel that shows information like the current floor, but when the total weight of passengers crosses a certain threshold it also adds a short note: &amp;ldquo;Sorry the elevator is crowded&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It struck me – of all possible features for an elevator display, how did they decide that they needed this one? It has no impact on the elevator&amp;rsquo;s function of moving people vertically. And a crowded elevator is not the elevator&amp;rsquo;s fault (although this is most likely just an example of Japan&amp;rsquo;s self-deprecating approach to hospitality). So why was this message deemed necessary?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
