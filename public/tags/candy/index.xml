      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a girl at a bus stop who appeared to have a cigarette in her mouth. &amp;ldquo;Yuck,&amp;rdquo; I thought. Then, I realized it was a lollipop. I immediately wanted to become her friend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You see, there is something special about lollipops. As far as your mouth is concerned, you could just as well be eating a normal hard candy. But the stick makes a world’s difference. You are proclaiming to the world, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am enjoying a candy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; There is no way to be inconspicuous about eating a lollipop. You have committed to this act, and do so with no shame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
