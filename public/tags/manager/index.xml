      <title>The Maker&#39;s Schedule - A Ten Year Retrospective</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;10 years ago, I was fresh out of college and encountered &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html&#34;&gt;Paul Graham&amp;rsquo;s essay&lt;/a&gt; about the maker&amp;rsquo;s schedule, and wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/programmers-stop-whining-be-productive&#34;&gt;a response&lt;/a&gt; disagreeing with the spirit of the article. While I knew and understood that programmers could be much more productive in one 10 hour chunk than in five 2 hour chunks, I felt like rearranging a business&amp;rsquo;s operations based on these preferences was going overboard. The typical programmer as described seemed undisciplined, and I wrote that programmers needed to find ways to work around distractions, which are simply a fact of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Programmers: Stop Whining, Be Productive</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[!NOTE] Update 2019&#xA;10 years later, I have posted a reflection on this piece [[the-maker&amp;rsquo;s-schedule-a-ten-year-retrospective | here]].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was pointed to &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html&#34;&gt;Paul Graham’s post&lt;/a&gt; about programmers running on a separate schedule than other people. Programmers run on the &amp;ldquo;maker’s schedule&amp;rdquo; and prefer to work in large chunks of time, with units of at least half a day. Others, particularly their bosses, operate on the &amp;ldquo;manager’s schedule&amp;rdquo; and have things defined into hour-long chunks. Interactions between the two typically cause friction:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
