      <title>Procrastination and Fear of Failure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I tend to procrastinate if I let myself, so I&amp;rsquo;ve tried my share of techniques to keep it in check. At some point, I read that a fear of failure can cause procrastination, and this really resonated with me. Realizing this has helped me understand where my urge to put things off is coming from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I have a large task in front of me, my mind rushes through everything that needs to be done and affirms how difficult it will be. I imagine (mostly subconsciously) all the ways that my output will be less than ideal, and that is what keeps me from taking action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;things-that-changed&#34;&gt;Things that changed&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have more time in the morning to do things around the house instead of commuting&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remote meetings are a little harder than in-person meetings&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I write daily reports about my work progress, equally to show my teammates that I’m staying on track, and to keep myself on track&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We watch the news a lot more&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don’t wear socks&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pushing my social life online has lead to me talking to friends more than before&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;things-that-didnt-change&#34;&gt;Things that didn’t change&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Waking up in the morning is hard&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Work hours are mostly the same, or a little longer from the lack of a commute&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is still a lot of work to do and I am busy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I still shave and brush my teeth and shower&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I get dressed in the morning&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We get groceries delivered once a week&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The world is stressful, but being able to stay at home is a blessing so total stress balances out&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The dog doesn’t seem to care that I’m around&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Shape Up - How Basecamp does Product Development</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/shape-up-how-basecamp-does-product-development/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/shape-up-how-basecamp-does-product-development/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://basecamp.com/shapeup&#34;&gt;Shape Up&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing new web-book by Basecamp that details the process they use to define, build, and ship their products. It has great insights, but I especially appreciated how many of the ideas presented just make a lot of sense. I often nodded along in agreement and recognized concepts that we share in our team. The framework is battle-tested and realistic, and there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to integrate some new ideas into our existing workflow without having to reorganize how we think about everything to fit a new metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Natural Lighting in the Office</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/natural-lighting-in-the-office/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/natural-lighting-in-the-office/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come to learn that I really enjoy working in environments with only natural lighting. At my job, I work in a large open room with about 50 people. Many of them are artists who need to minimize the glare on their screens, so the great big windows covering the walls of our room are always covered with blinds, and we instead have fluorescent lights turned on (these do cause glare too, but at least they are more predictable so people can tilt their screens to minimize it).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Maker&#39;s Schedule - A Ten Year Retrospective</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-makers-schedule-a-ten-year-retrospective/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-makers-schedule-a-ten-year-retrospective/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;10 years ago, I was fresh out of college and encountered &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html&#34;&gt;Paul Graham&amp;rsquo;s essay&lt;/a&gt; about the maker&amp;rsquo;s schedule, and wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/programmers-stop-whining-be-productive&#34;&gt;a response&lt;/a&gt; disagreeing with the spirit of the article. While I knew and understood that programmers could be much more productive in one 10 hour chunk than in five 2 hour chunks, I felt like rearranging a business&amp;rsquo;s operations based on these preferences was going overboard. The typical programmer as described seemed undisciplined, and I wrote that programmers needed to find ways to work around distractions, which are simply a fact of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Five Steps to an Effective Tech Team</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/five-steps-to-an-effective-tech-team/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/five-steps-to-an-effective-tech-team/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently experienced two of the most informative and useful meetings of my life. Lloyd Taylor, the former VP of Technical Operations at LinkedIn, and Olana Khan, the former COO of Kiva, graciously donated their time to speak to us about how to organize our technology goals. We had been in the process of formalizing our thoughts for an upcoming board meeting, but their expert feedback allowed us to cement in some much-needed structure. In addition, we also were given invaluable advice about how to lead an effective technology team in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Programmers: Stop Whining, Be Productive</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/programmers-stop-whining-be-productive/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[!NOTE] Update 2019&#xA;10 years later, I have posted a reflection on this piece [[the-maker&amp;rsquo;s-schedule-a-ten-year-retrospective | here]].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was pointed to &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html&#34;&gt;Paul Graham’s post&lt;/a&gt; about programmers running on a separate schedule than other people. Programmers run on the &amp;ldquo;maker’s schedule&amp;rdquo; and prefer to work in large chunks of time, with units of at least half a day. Others, particularly their bosses, operate on the &amp;ldquo;manager’s schedule&amp;rdquo; and have things defined into hour-long chunks. Interactions between the two typically cause friction:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
