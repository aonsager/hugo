      <description>&lt;p&gt;Things I am looking forward to in&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-year-2026&#34;&gt;The year 2026&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;fridays&#34;&gt;Fridays&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kid2 will enter kindergarten, which means a sudden increase in time with no kids in the house. Since I work remotely on Fridays, this creates some opportunities for precious free-time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will be really nice to be able to spend some quiet time during the day with my wife. I would love to have semi-regular lunch dates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The kids&amp;rsquo; swimming school has a plan that lets parents of enrolled kids use the pool freely for a very reasonable monthly fee. I want to start swimming on Friday mornings. I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at swimming, but I do want to get better, and I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that it will be a good source of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
