      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always been a calm and happy person. Aggressively optimistic, even. I made it through the first 1/3 of my life without feeling much stress, only getting angry on rare occasions. Anger management, emotional therapy, mindfulness exercises, these were all things that I had no need for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought that this was a personality trait, but now I realize that I was simply blessed with an easy life. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I was particularly good at dealing with stress, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have much stress coming my way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
