      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://basecamp.com/shapeup&#34;&gt;Shape Up&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing new web-book by Basecamp that details the process they use to define, build, and ship their products. It has great insights, but I especially appreciated how many of the ideas presented just make a lot of sense. I often nodded along in agreement and recognized concepts that we share in our team. The framework is battle-tested and realistic, and there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to integrate some new ideas into our existing workflow without having to reorganize how we think about everything to fit a new metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
