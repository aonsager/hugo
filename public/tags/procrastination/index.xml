      <description>&lt;p&gt;I tend to procrastinate if I let myself, so I&amp;rsquo;ve tried my share of techniques to keep it in check. At some point, I read that a fear of failure can cause procrastination, and this really resonated with me. Realizing this has helped me understand where my urge to put things off is coming from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I have a large task in front of me, my mind rushes through everything that needs to be done and affirms how difficult it will be. I imagine (mostly subconsciously) all the ways that my output will be less than ideal, and that is what keeps me from taking action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
