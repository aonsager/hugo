      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve avoided collecting too much stuff. I buy Kindle versions of books whenever possible, but there is a small shelf for the few books I have carried around with me over the years. My son, who is not quite two years old, will sometimes rummage through my books and leave them in a heap once he realizes there are no pictures, but it made me remember what my own father&amp;rsquo;s bookshelf was like for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
