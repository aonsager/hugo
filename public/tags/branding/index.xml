      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first started this personal website just about 20 years ago. It began as a couple of html pages, and spent time as a Wordpress blog, a Tumblr page, and is now a static blog generated by Jekyll. Through that time, it had always just had my name, alexonsager.com. This year, I’m rebranding it to &lt;strong&gt;Invisible Parade&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;being-online-then&#34;&gt;Being online then&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I started this site I had just entered university, got my first MacBook, and was excited to become a full-fledged citizen of the internet. At the time, I thought it was cool to publish as much of yourself as possible. Tag yourself and your friends in the photos you take, scrobble the music you listen to, check in to the places you go, tweet your thoughts. Since I was broadcasting myself to the world, it made sense to put my name on my website. That’s how people would know me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
