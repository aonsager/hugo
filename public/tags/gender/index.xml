      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In 1990, Marilyn vos Savant correctly answered a probability puzzle in her column for Parade Magazine. And then, the world called her an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I still remember the chaos caused by the Monty Hall problem in our high school math class. Here&#39;s my explanation for how it works:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your first choice could either be a car or a goat.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;If you picked the car, you will win the car by not changing your guess.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;If you picked a goat, the host will reveal the second goat. The last door left will be the car, so you are guaranteed to win if you change your guess.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You have two possible strategies to win the car:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Try to pick the car on your first guess, and don&#39;t change the guess.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Try to pick a goat on your first guess, and change the guess after the host opens another door.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The second strategy is better, since picking a goat is twice as easy as picking the car.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best strategy is to &lt;em&gt;try to pick a goat&lt;/em&gt; in round 1. Once the host has revealed the second goat, you are guaranteed the car by switching doors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mattsgifs.com/post/73774946424&#34;&gt;During an E! interview at a red carpet ceremony&lt;/a&gt;, the camera operator takes a sweeping toe-to-head shot of Cate Blanchett, when she crouches down to ask, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you do that to the guys?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; The internet explodes with opinion, and more fuel is added to the increasing fight against the objectification of women in media.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, the camera operator was just doing their job. Red carpet ceremonies are events focused on fashion, and Cate Blanchett was wearing a very nice gown that should be seen in its entirety. No, most male guests would not have received the same treatment, because most male guests would be wearing suits or tuxedos and everybody knows what black pants look like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
