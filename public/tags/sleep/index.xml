      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was consistently able to have lucid dreams when I was in high school. Partway through a dream, I would realize that I was dreaming and could then control the rest of the dream to a small extent. As I&amp;rsquo;ve grown older though, this has become less and less common. Maybe age has changed something about my brain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in lucid dreaming and have read a lot about it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://tim.blog/2009/09/21/how-to-lucid-dream/&#34;&gt;Tim Ferriss has a fascinating beginner&amp;rsquo;s guide on his blog&lt;/a&gt;. Different people seem to have different approaches and theories, so I thought I would write about my own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
