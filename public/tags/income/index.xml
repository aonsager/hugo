      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder sometimes about what a better society than ours would be. What should our goals be as we try to improve?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As our society improves and we get more efficient, I like to imagine a future where we don&amp;rsquo;t have to work as much. That seems like a nice thing to aim for. Universal basic income (UBI) seems like one possible solution. If we could afford to give everybody a fixed minimal income, people could work less and still have a basic amount of wealth needed to survive. But I&amp;rsquo;m not yet convinced whether UBI is the correct answer to describe an ideal future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
