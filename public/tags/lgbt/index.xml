      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a supporter of LGBT rights. I&#39;m generally not too vocal about it, but with recent events culminating in the Orlando mass shootings, I had to say something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the LGBT rights movement recently. Hopefully this effort can be another step forward following the Civil Rights Movement, as we work towards equal rights and treatment for all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Civil Rights Act made it illegal to discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Setting religion aside for a moment, the rest are distinctions that generally lead to noticeable physical differences. The ease of identification is probably one factor that helped the prejudice spread so much, and led to institutional disenfranchisement as well as terrible acts of discrimination and violence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
