      <description>&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, I fancied myself a writer and strove to write beautiful prose. I read a lot and borrowed from styles that I admired, but oftentimes my sentences ran on, and I relied on my thesaurus too heavily. But I enjoyed the process of writing and reached a familiarity with words that allowed me to simply let my thoughts flow through my fingers onto the page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At university, I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style&#34;&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/a&gt; and quickly became an advocate instead of lean, effective prose. I strove to convey my thoughts using fewer words. Composition took more effort as I scrutinized each phrase. I was happy with the results, and I felt a deliberate craftsmanship that seemed more pronounced than before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
