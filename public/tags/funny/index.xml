      <description>&lt;p&gt;Q: What do you do when you&amp;rsquo;re being scammed by a Chinese scam artist?&#xA;A: Use their country&amp;rsquo;s internet censorship against them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LINE, the hugely popular Japanese messaging app, has been seeing a recent surge in scamming activity. In the most common scenario, the scam artist will gain access to a user&amp;rsquo;s account and message their friends, asking them to purchase online gift cards and send the serial number. Many people were targeted by this scam, and it received some mainstream media attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
