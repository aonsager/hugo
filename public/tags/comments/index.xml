      <description>&lt;p&gt;This site has gone through many forms, and comments have come and gone. Now they are back, made possible by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/souramoo/commentoplusplus&#34;&gt;commento++&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://commento.io&#34;&gt;Commento&lt;/a&gt; was popular and on my radar for a while, but the original repository has been dead for a while. Commento++ is a fork that has been dead for&amp;hellip; a little bit less of a while. But it has a few improvements from the original, and as long as it&amp;rsquo;s stable I don&amp;rsquo;t care so much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
