      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mobile games can make a crazy amount of money. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_%26_Dragons&#34;&gt;Puzzles and Dragons&lt;/a&gt; at its peak was said to be earning &lt;em&gt;$100 million per month&lt;/em&gt;! Why do people spend so much?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mobile games are generally much more simple than traditional video games, so they can&amp;rsquo;t provide the same rich experiences as traditional video games. Instead, they engage their core users by providing a satisfying experience of winning, especially against other players. Since people often play mobile games in their spare time, money is used as a shortcut to win quickly and efficiently. The entire game&amp;rsquo;s structure is built around creating an environment to support people who are willing to pay large amounts of money in order to win.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
