      <description>&lt;p&gt;I look at reviews before buying things, and I prefer personal websites and youtube channels over large publications because I can get a feel for the person behind the opinions, and their preferences. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed though that reviews gravitate towards a certain subset of good, but mostly American brands. This is only a problem because I live in Japan, where limited availability and terrible exchange rates makes everything feel twice as expensive as they ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
