      <description>&lt;p&gt;My daily commute includes a 20-minute bike ride to the train station. I started this as a way to keep my body moving, but I&amp;rsquo;ve come to love it for the freedom it gives my mind. I can think about whatever I want to, but it&amp;rsquo;s also all right to not think about anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The weather is nice today, and I listen to the birds talking at one another.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sun has started getting higher in the sky when I leave, so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to start wearing my sunglasses again soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always been a calm and happy person. Aggressively optimistic, even. I made it through the first 1/3 of my life without feeling much stress, only getting angry on rare occasions. Anger management, emotional therapy, mindfulness exercises, these were all things that I had no need for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought that this was a personality trait, but now I realize that I was simply blessed with an easy life. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I was particularly good at dealing with stress, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have much stress coming my way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
