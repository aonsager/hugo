<p>30cm×85cm wool desk mat from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CRPZZBFS">amesoba</a>.</p>
<p><img src="amesoba-mat.jpg" alt="My current desk setup" title="My current desk setup"></p>
<p>This desk mat is fantastic. The natural wool material has been treated to have none of the typical scratchiness, and it&rsquo;s comfortable for my wrists while giving a smooth surface for a mouse, too.</p>
<p>30×90 is a more standard size, but 90cm felt a little bit too big for me, so this 85cm width is perfect.</p>
<p>One thing I should note is that there is no rubber on the bottom to prevent the mat from sliding. I have never had a problem with it (maybe because I have a heavy keyboard) but it is something to keep in mind. One the plus side, it&rsquo;s reversible!</p>
<p>Ah, I just noticed that you can opt for having a cork bottom for a little bit extra. I totally missed that when I bought mine!</p>

<p>Cashmere desk pad from <a href="https://shop.minimaldesksetups.com/products/desk-pad?variant=47324556951745">Minimal Desk Setups</a></p>
<p>This desk pad is also great! There is nothing really wrong with it, but there are two things that makes me prefer the amesoba.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is just a touch of the wool scratchiness. Not enough to bother me, or be a problem, but enough that I do notice it.</li>
<li>As mentioned about, the 90cm width felt a little bit too much. My desk was really dominated by the mat. I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought that 5cm would make such a difference, but here we are.</li>
</ol>

<p>I also tried this desk mat from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0C16R4SGF">BREENHILL</a>.</p>
<p>I got it because it was cheap, and it was fine, but not joyous. I&rsquo;m just being picky here, but the above two mats actually made me look forward to sitting at my desk, whereas the BREENHILL was more just&hellip; there. But it should be a perfectly good, budget-friendly option if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
