  <blockquote>
<p>Wag was looking to raise $75 million. It went to SoftBank and was like &ldquo;will you give us $75 million?&rdquo; SoftBank was like &ldquo;no haha we’ll give you $300 million,&rdquo; because that is SoftBank’s whole thing, it loves to give startups vastly more money than they want or need. And so Wag took the money. And then like a year and a half later Wag will get rid of SoftBank by giving back, I don’t know, but I am going to say some number less than $225 million (&ldquo;well below&rdquo; the valuation at which it invested). Wag got the $75 million it needed for free.</p>

<p>So under the right circumstances, you can make more money with a flop than you can with a hit!</p>
<p>Wag wasn&rsquo;t exactly a flop, but SoftBank&rsquo;s aggressive investment strategy does result in some pretty unusual situations.</p>
