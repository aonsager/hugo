  <p><a href="http://stilldrinking.org/nobody-understands-punctuation">Peter Welch</a> has published an excellent piece on punctuation and writing style in the English language.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, you can use punctuation in incorrect ways, but that does not mean there is only one way to use it. A friend recently told me publishers don&rsquo;t care whether you use an oxford comma or not, as long as you pick one and stick with it. This is stupid. If punctuation obscures or distorts the meaning of a sentence in an unintended way, it is wrong, but apart from that, punctuation is about rhythm. An Oxford comma is not a flip switch in an author&rsquo;s voice, it&rsquo;s a decision made in the moment to maintain the flow of the idea. Momentum, syncopation, rhythm and pattern make a sentence flow, because writers are trying to transfer the voices in their heads into yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I own a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Elements-Style-Fourth-Edition/dp/020530902X">The Elements of Style</a> which is one of the most prescriptive books around regarding what &ldquo;good writing&rdquo; is. Though Welch&rsquo;s essay has a nearly opposite message, urging writers to do what they must at the expense of constrictive rules, I love both for describing excellent writing and leading by example.</p>
<p>I do believe that there can be a single guiding principle for good writing. At their core, the two contrasting works in fact have the same core message: be deliberate.</p>
