      <h2><a href="/links/stupidity-science/">The importance of stupidity in scientific research</a></h2>
      <p>From <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~fukamit/schwartz-2008.pdf">Martin A. Schwartz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. Focusing on important questions puts us in the awkward position of being ignorant. One of the beautiful things about science is that it allows us to bumble along, getting it wrong time after time, and feel perfectly fine as long as we learn something each time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There seems to be a constant pressure to be &ldquo;right&rdquo;, but there are definitely situations where that&rsquo;s impossible. Sometimes, being wrong is correct. It&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to allow ourselves to enjoy bumbling and exploring, but it is so important.</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>Modern chess is the culmination of centuries of experience, as well as an evolutionary sequence of rule adjustments from its inception in the 6th century to the modern rules we know today. While classical chess still captivates the minds of millions of players worldwide, the game is anything but static. Many variants have been proposed and played over the years by enthusiasts and theorists. They continue the evolutionary cycle by altering the board, piece placement, or the rules—offering players &ldquo;something subtle, sparkling, or amusing which cannot be done in ordinary chess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch is designed to be portable, so it doesn’t have a disc drive. Instead, its games come on cartridges, just like games for Nintendo’s handheld platforms stretching back to the original Game Boy. But there’s something different about Switch cartridges: <em>They taste awful</em>.</p>
<p>Update (March 2): In a statement emailed to Polygon, a Nintendo representative confirmed the theory that Switch cartridges are coated in a material that’s meant to dissuade people from putting the units in their mouths.</p>

<p>Wag was looking to raise $75 million. It went to SoftBank and was like &ldquo;will you give us $75 million?&rdquo; SoftBank was like &ldquo;no haha we’ll give you $300 million,&rdquo; because that is SoftBank’s whole thing, it loves to give startups vastly more money than they want or need. And so Wag took the money. And then like a year and a half later Wag will get rid of SoftBank by giving back, I don’t know, but I am going to say some number less than $225 million (&ldquo;well below&rdquo; the valuation at which it invested). Wag got the $75 million it needed for free.</p>

<p>I still remember the chaos caused by the Monty Hall problem in our high school math class. Here's my explanation for how it works:</p>
<ul><li>Your first choice could either be a car or a goat.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>If you picked the car, you will win the car by not changing your guess.</li>
    <li>If you picked a goat, the host will reveal the second goat. The last door left will be the car, so you are guaranteed to win if you change your guess.</li>
  </ol>
<li>You have two possible strategies to win the car:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Try to pick the car on your first guess, and don't change the guess.</li>
    <li>Try to pick a goat on your first guess, and change the guess after the host opens another door.</li>
  </ol>
<li>The second strategy is better, since picking a goat is twice as easy as picking the car.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best strategy is to <em>try to pick a goat</em> in round 1. Once the host has revealed the second goat, you are guaranteed the car by switching doors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, you can use punctuation in incorrect ways, but that does not mean there is only one way to use it. A friend recently told me publishers don&rsquo;t care whether you use an oxford comma or not, as long as you pick one and stick with it. This is stupid. If punctuation obscures or distorts the meaning of a sentence in an unintended way, it is wrong, but apart from that, punctuation is about rhythm. An Oxford comma is not a flip switch in an author&rsquo;s voice, it&rsquo;s a decision made in the moment to maintain the flow of the idea. Momentum, syncopation, rhythm and pattern make a sentence flow, because writers are trying to transfer the voices in their heads into yours.</p>

      <p>I personally am worried by the dependency on Evernote, but it seems like a great way to get a web presence if you&rsquo;re a heavy user already.</p>

      <h2><a href="/links/chrono-trigger-retrospective/">Chrono Trigger Retrospective</a></h2>
      <blockquote>
<p>Chrono Trigger basically began as a jam session — a couple of star designers and a manga artist getting together to brainstorm and seeing what they might produce. No pressure. No cynicism.</p>
<p>[ . . . ]</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best thing about Chrono Trigger is something that can’t quite be quantified in terms of mechanics, aesthetics, or plot. It’s impossible to play without getting the sense that that its designers really had a lot of fun in conceiving it (barring a stomach ulcer or two) and were wholly dedicated to making sure they got it right. Chrono Trigger is a labor of love effected by a group of very talented game designers, and their enthusiasm for the project permeates every aspect of the experience.</p>

      <p>It's always exciting to see original prototypes of good products. Not to mention the sample conversation going on in there is rather delightful.  </p>

      <p>I'm definitely glad they keep iterating until they got to the current version, but that 2nd revision&rsquo;s pretty neat too.</p>

      <h2><a href="/links/buy-a-mac/">Buy a mac</a></h2>
      <p>This article is so strange. It shows all the reasons why buying a PC with Windows Vista is a terrible idea, and yet the author seems perfectly happy with his Vista computer, even after paying absurd amounts of money to fix something that shouldn&rsquo;t have broke in the first place.  </p>
