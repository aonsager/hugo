      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://provector.app/&#34;&gt;Provector&lt;/a&gt; is a really useful web app for making simple SVG graphics. I find it really handy for throwing together simple logo ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The importance of stupidity in scientific research</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/links/stupidity-science/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.stanford.edu/~fukamit/schwartz-2008.pdf&#34;&gt;Martin A. Schwartz&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. Focusing on important questions puts us in the awkward position of being ignorant. One of the beautiful things about science is that it allows us to bumble along, getting it wrong time after time, and feel perfectly fine as long as we learn something each time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a constant pressure to be &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo;, but there are definitely situations where that&amp;rsquo;s impossible. Sometimes, being wrong is correct. It&amp;rsquo;s getting harder and harder to allow ourselves to enjoy bumbling and exploring, but it is so important.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It acts as a Wi-Fi hotspot with preloaded data that can serve the community. Wikipedia, eBooks, online courses, medical reference material, the possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Game Developer Magazine:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We recently received a request to publish the Katamari Damacy postmortem from the December 2004 issue of Game Developer. It has been posted here in full for the first time in 2024 to celebrate the game&amp;rsquo;s 20 year anniversary. Please enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article was written by the game&amp;rsquo;s director, Keita Takahashi, and has been translated into English from the original Japanese. I wish I could find the original text, but this is a great read regardless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dragonsweeper - A lovely minesweeper game</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/links/dragonsweeper---a-lovely-minesweeper-game/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/links/dragonsweeper---a-lovely-minesweeper-game/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a really excellent take on minesweeper. Spaces can contain monsters of various strength, and you need to spend HP to defeat them. By collecting EXP and hearts to level up and heal yourself, the goal is to become strong enough to slay the dragon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It took me a few tries to get a handle on the strategy, but this is super fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the repository:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Litestack is a Ruby gem that provides both Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications an all-in-one solution for web application data infrastructure. It exploits the power and embeddedness of SQLite to deliver a full-fledged SQL database, a fast cache , a robust job queue, a reliable message broker, a full text search engine and a metrics platform all in a single package.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning Python for my small projects recently, but for something that wants a full stack I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be checking this out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A very relaxing video by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.russellhoughten.com/&#34;&gt;Russell Houghten&lt;/a&gt; showing skateboarders riding around L.A. with all of the cars edited out. It&amp;rsquo;s executed wonderfully. How much effort goes into something like this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reimagining Chess with AlphaZero</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/links/reimagining-chess-with-alphazero/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/links/reimagining-chess-with-alphazero/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern chess is the culmination of centuries of experience, as well as an evolutionary sequence of rule adjustments from its inception in the 6th century to the modern rules we know today. While classical chess still captivates the minds of millions of players worldwide, the game is anything but static. Many variants have been proposed and played over the years by enthusiasts and theorists. They continue the evolutionary cycle by altering the board, piece placement, or the rules—offering players &amp;ldquo;something subtle, sparkling, or amusing which cannot be done in ordinary chess.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Switch Cartridges Taste Awful</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/links/why-switch-cartridges-taste-awful/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/links/why-switch-cartridges-taste-awful/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Nintendo Switch is designed to be portable, so it doesn’t have a disc drive. Instead, its games come on cartridges, just like games for Nintendo’s handheld platforms stretching back to the original Game Boy. But there’s something different about Switch cartridges: &lt;em&gt;They taste awful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Update (March 2): In a statement emailed to Polygon, a Nintendo representative confirmed the theory that Switch cartridges are coated in a material that’s meant to dissuade people from putting the units in their mouths.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The colors add a great bit of flavor especially to scenes in space that would otherwise be predominantly black and grey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Box Line Text: A minimal whiteboard app</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/links/box-line-text-a-minimal-whiteboard-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/links/box-line-text-a-minimal-whiteboard-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a great implementation of an extremely minimal whiteboard app. There is no UI, and you can click to add text or click+drag to add boxes and lines. Zoom options in your browser will change the size, and you can save the HTML if you want to keep a copy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably not enough for work meetings, but I thought it was a great, fun product.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wag Buys Shares Back from SoftBank</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/links/wag-buys-shares-back-from-softbank/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/links/wag-buys-shares-back-from-softbank/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wag was looking to raise $75 million. It went to SoftBank and was like &amp;ldquo;will you give us $75 million?&amp;rdquo; SoftBank was like &amp;ldquo;no haha we’ll give you $300 million,&amp;rdquo; because that is SoftBank’s whole thing, it loves to give startups vastly more money than they want or need. And so Wag took the money. And then like a year and a half later Wag will get rid of SoftBank by giving back, I don’t know, but I am going to say some number less than $225 million (&amp;ldquo;well below&amp;rdquo; the valuation at which it invested). Wag got the $75 million it needed for free.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Because the leather molds to your feet over time, the shoes become more comfortable the more you wear them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They are a little pricey, but they should last a long time and the cost is completely reasonable considering the work that goes into them. And there are plenty of sneakers that cost even more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some of the results are surprisingly great:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have just been informed, that the debate over the question ‘is it right or wrong to have immortal souls’ has been finally brought to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was a boy, I was fond of the story of the pirate god.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He had a strange name, and he was a very big boy indeed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The inner end of the loop acts as the hour hand, and the outer end is the minute hand. The in-between part seems to move freely, so you have a watch face that looks pretty different each time you look at it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d probably need to pause for a few seconds to decipher the time so it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly practical, but it would be a good conversation starter for sure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You can use it with small images for free, and pricing for HD photos seems very fair: you can pay $2 per image, or get a subscription starting at $9 per month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We did not doubt it for a moment and we installed a supercomputer in it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A robot arm dips a pipette into a dish and transfers a tiny amount of bright liquid into one of many receptacles sitting in front of another machine. When all the samples are ready, the second machine tests their optical properties, and the results are fed to a computer that controls the arm. Software analyzes the results of these experiments, formulates a few hypotheses, and then starts the process over again. Humans are barely required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://picular.co/&#34;&gt;Picular&lt;/a&gt; is a site that lets you search for words like &amp;ldquo;water&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;summer&amp;rdquo; and see a list of related colors. It seems to work by running a Google image search and extracting the primary color of that image.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of project I love. It&amp;rsquo;s simple and easy to understand, but fun to play with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In 1990, Marilyn vos Savant correctly answered a probability puzzle in her column for Parade Magazine. And then, the world called her an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I still remember the chaos caused by the Monty Hall problem in our high school math class. Here&#39;s my explanation for how it works:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your first choice could either be a car or a goat.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;If you picked the car, you will win the car by not changing your guess.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;If you picked a goat, the host will reveal the second goat. The last door left will be the car, so you are guaranteed to win if you change your guess.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You have two possible strategies to win the car:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Try to pick the car on your first guess, and don&#39;t change the guess.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Try to pick a goat on your first guess, and change the guess after the host opens another door.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The second strategy is better, since picking a goat is twice as easy as picking the car.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best strategy is to &lt;em&gt;try to pick a goat&lt;/em&gt; in round 1. Once the host has revealed the second goat, you are guaranteed the car by switching doors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You can trigger an AWS Lambda function to automatically create a thumbnail when an image is uploaded to Amazon S3, verify address updates in an Amazon DynamoDB table, or process click-stream data in an Amazon Kinesis stream, without having to manage any compute infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Billing is metered in increments of 100 milliseconds, making it cost-effective and easy to scale automatically from a few requests per day to thousands per second.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My team and I wrote an app that will apply findings from a recent research paper to your Facebook graph. The app won’t post to your wall but it will show you both the shape of your friend network and which of your friends are most mathematically important to your life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking at a metric like the number of friends you have in common, this algorithm takes it a step further. It looks at how well connected your mutual friends are with each other, and suggests that having more diverse mutual friends indicates a stronger, more important relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t notice I’m polite, which is sort of the point. I don’t look polite. I am big and droopy and need a haircut. No soul would associate me with watercress sandwiches. Still, every year or so someone takes me aside and says, you actually are weirdly polite, aren’t you? And I always thrill. They noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Politeness buys you time. It leaves doors open. I’ve met so many people whom, if I had trusted my first impressions, I would never have wanted to meet again. And yet — many of them are now great friends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Euclid The Game is a puzzle game that challenges you to use simple methods like drawing circles, translating lines, and bisecting angles to solve geometric puzzles. Very addicting, and it made me remember just how powerful tools like a compass can be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://stilldrinking.org/nobody-understands-punctuation&#34;&gt;Peter Welch&lt;/a&gt; has published an excellent piece on punctuation and writing style in the English language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can use punctuation in incorrect ways, but that does not mean there is only one way to use it. A friend recently told me publishers don&amp;rsquo;t care whether you use an oxford comma or not, as long as you pick one and stick with it. This is stupid. If punctuation obscures or distorts the meaning of a sentence in an unintended way, it is wrong, but apart from that, punctuation is about rhythm. An Oxford comma is not a flip switch in an author&amp;rsquo;s voice, it&amp;rsquo;s a decision made in the moment to maintain the flow of the idea. Momentum, syncopation, rhythm and pattern make a sentence flow, because writers are trying to transfer the voices in their heads into yours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A chilling story told by a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay. I hope that someday we&amp;rsquo;ll look back and wonder how anything like this could have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been detained at Guantánamo for 11 years and three months. I have never been charged with any crime. I have never received a trial.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The situation is desperate now. All of the detainees here are suffering deeply. At least 40 people here are on a hunger strike. People are fainting with exhaustion every day. I have vomited blood.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And there is no end in sight to our imprisonment. Denying ourselves food and risking death every day is the choice we have made.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I just hope that because of the pain we are suffering, the eyes of the world will once again look to Guantánamo before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/links/chrono-trigger-retrospective/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chrono Trigger basically began as a jam session — a couple of star designers and a manga artist getting together to brainstorm and seeing what they might produce. No pressure. No cynicism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[ . . . ]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the best thing about Chrono Trigger is something that can’t quite be quantified in terms of mechanics, aesthetics, or plot. It’s impossible to play without getting the sense that that its designers really had a lot of fun in conceiving it (barring a stomach ulcer or two) and were wholly dedicated to making sure they got it right. Chrono Trigger is a labor of love effected by a group of very talented game designers, and their enthusiasm for the project permeates every aspect of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
