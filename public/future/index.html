  <p>Things I am looking forward to in&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="the-year-2026">The year 2026</h2>
<h3 id="fridays">Fridays</h3>
<p>Kid2 will enter kindergarten, which means a sudden increase in time with no kids in the house. Since I work remotely on Fridays, this creates some opportunities for precious free-time.</p>
<p>It will be really nice to be able to spend some quiet time during the day with my wife. I would love to have semi-regular lunch dates.</p>
<p>The kids&rsquo; swimming school has a plan that lets parents of enrolled kids use the pool freely for a very reasonable monthly fee. I want to start swimming on Friday mornings. I&rsquo;m terrible at swimming, but I do want to get better, and I&rsquo;m hopeful that it will be a good source of exercise.</p>
<h3 id="gaming-with-the-kids">Gaming with the kids</h3>
<p>Kid1 has been playing on our Switch, and he&rsquo;s getting pretty good at Kirby Discovery. In 2026 we will probably branch out into more games, and I&rsquo;m excited to go through that experience with him.</p>
<p>In addition to video games, we&rsquo;ve been playing Othello and Shogi together, which is also a lot of fun. I want to keep this up, and also start branching into other board games and card games.</p>
<p>Kid2 can almost follow the rules of Candy Land, so family game nights are maybe not too far off.</p>
<h2 id="my-30s-20172026">My 30s (2017–2026)</h2>
<p>(I&rsquo;m almost done already so this is kind of cheating, but)</p>
<p>This is the decade where I grow my family and solidify my life.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to have kids, hopefully 2.</li>
<li>It would be nice to buy a house, but that requires thinking about where we want to live. USA vs Japan is a big choice.</li>
<li>I should probably think about growing into a new role at work. I still feel like one of the young guys, but I&rsquo;m actually getting fairly senior.</li>
<li>I want to stay healthy, so that I&rsquo;m not hampered physically when interacting with future kids.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-40s-20272036">My 40s (2027–2036)</h2>
<p>This is the decade where my kids grow into their teens (wow that is terrifying).</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to be a strong, supportive parent in my kids&rsquo; lives.</li>
<li>I want to help them to grow into whatever they will become, without being too heavy-handed in what <em>I think</em> they should become.</li>
<li>I want to adjust into having more time for myself at home, while the kids start doing their own things more and more. I want to be a productive and contributing member of our family.</li>
<li>I might be able to put more time and effort into work. This may include leading the production of a game myself.</li>
<li>I want to put more active effort into staying healthy and fit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-50s-20372046">My 50s (2037–2046)</h2>
<p>This is the decade where my kids will go through high school and college, eventually going off as adults.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to give my kids whatever they need to be successful, independent adults.</li>
<li>I want to find a good, strong relationship with my kids as a pair of adults. I&rsquo;m not sure how hard this transition will be.</li>
<li>I want to continue to stay healthy and fit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-60s-20472056">My 60s (2047–2056)</h2>
<p>Somewhere in here I hope to retire. I&rsquo;m am really looking forward to my retirement! Writing down the things I want to do was a big motivator to putting together this document.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to travel with my wife. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a lot, but there is a list of places we want to go and I don&rsquo;t want to ignore it.</li>
<li>I want to spend more time in my local community. Exploring small local shops, visiting the library, little things like that that tend to fall through the cracks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-70s-20572066">My 70s (2057–2066)</h2>
<p>More of the same? I&rsquo;m not really sure yet. I&rsquo;ll leave this (and the rest) blank.</p>
