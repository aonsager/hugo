  <p>Hello, and welcome to my website. Web development is one of my favorite hobbies, and becoming a proficient writer is one of my greatest ambitions. This is a space for me to practice the two.</p>
<p>In addition to being a blog, this is a freeform space for me to build – and hopefully grow – a personal knowledge-base.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-site">About this site</h2>
<p>I write notes using <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>, and use <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz">Quartz</a> to transform my notes into a functional website. You can look at the [[Colophon]] for information about how this site is built. I have a running list of [[Site todo | todos]] that I want to take care of.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure what the best way to organize things is here, so they might be a lot of reorganizing for a while. For now, the vision is to just tag everything and see what happens. Maybe I will make a tag cloud to aid exploration. Maybe I will expose a list of related pages for each page. I&rsquo;m not sure yet, but I think I have a lot of options.</p>
<p>Please note that this site has a great search function. You can use the search bar in the upper-left, or press  <code>⌘</code>/<code>ctrl</code> + <code>K</code>.</p>

<p>My name is Alex. I grew up near Boulder, CO and spent most of my childhood reading books, playing music, and playing video games. I learned programming by making bad games for my TI-83 calculator. The first things I published online were bad flash websites.</p>
<p>In college I studied programming and human-computer interaction. A team of classmates and I made <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/These-Stanford-Students-Made-Millions-Taking-A-2361888.php">a few apps</a> on Facebook, which eventually turned into a startup. This was the first time I made something that was used by a large number of people. It became my introduction to making real products that have users and make money.</p>
<p>I have been working at a mobile game company in Japan since 2010. Because my day-job doesn&rsquo;t currently involve much programming, I like to work on fun [[projects]] on the side that let me build things directly.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I maintain this site is the hope that it will help me make more connections online. Please feel free to [[contact | get in touch]]! It would make me very happy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently realized that including software-specific text in my post and pages creates a lot of mental overhead. I make use of a number of handy shortcode functions. For example, creating an image block with descriptions and alt code, with an optional caption using <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> if I want to provide extra commentary or link back to the source. This is handy, but there are two big problems:</p>

      <p>When I’m having fun with a hobby, nothing kills my motivation faster than learning about a better, more efficient way I could be doing things.</p>
<p>I was playing Fantasy Life i – chopping trees, making boots, fishing fish, and just generally having a grand time. It felt like alchemy skills were taking longer than the rest to level up, so i checked a wiki to see if i was missing something. Big mistake. What i learned is that, if i haven’t created 4 sunglasses with EXP boost buffs and then started crafting 10 thousand health potions to power level, I’m wasting my time.</p>

      <h2><a href="/links/stupidity-science/">The importance of stupidity in scientific research</a></h2>
      <p>From <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~fukamit/schwartz-2008.pdf">Martin A. Schwartz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. Focusing on important questions puts us in the awkward position of being ignorant. One of the beautiful things about science is that it allows us to bumble along, getting it wrong time after time, and feel perfectly fine as long as we learn something each time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There seems to be a constant pressure to be &ldquo;right&rdquo;, but there are definitely situations where that&rsquo;s impossible. Sometimes, being wrong is correct. It&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to allow ourselves to enjoy bumbling and exploring, but it is so important.</p>

      <h2><a href="/notes/claude-code/">Claude Code</a></h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve started using Claude Code&rsquo;s Pro plan for personal programming projects, and it&rsquo;s unbelievable how useful this is as a tool. I&rsquo;ve sort of known it for a while, but I can&rsquo;t comprehend a future where using coding assistants like this is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>It helps a lot that I have programming experience, and experience managing large projects. Created structured steps and guiding Claude through the workflow feels natural, and I&rsquo;m already getting solid results. This can only improve as I gain more experience, and the tools become more powerful.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/buy-local/">Buy local</a></h2>
      <p>I look at reviews before buying things, and I prefer personal websites and youtube channels over large publications because I can get a feel for the person behind the opinions, and their preferences. I&rsquo;ve noticed though that reviews gravitate towards a certain subset of good, but mostly American brands. This is only a problem because I live in Japan, where limited availability and terrible exchange rates makes everything feel twice as expensive as they ought to be.</p>

      <p><a href="https://blog.jakesaunders.dev/my-server-started-mining-monero-this-morning/">Jake Saunders wrote</a> about discovering that a recent Next.js vulnerability allowed hackers access to their server through an Umami instance. I use Umami, too!</p>
<p>I logged into my VPS and didn&rsquo;t see any suspicious files or running processes. I then opened my Umami dashboard to poke around, and my browser immediately opened a window to a gambling site. Well, shit.</p>
<h2 id="damage-assessment">Damage assessment</h2>
<p>The browser&rsquo;s developer console showed that an <code>onclick</code> event was added to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> object, and this was originating from a file disguised to look like a standard Next.js library file used by Umami. So the attacker was able to modify and add files, as well as spoof the modified date to hide their tracks.</p>

I didn&rsquo;t get the Pro version, as I don&rsquo;t really need a dial or media keys, and I preferred the smaller size anyways.

      <p>I wanted to copy slides from one Google Slide document to another. Half-expecting it to not work, I just copied slides in one document, switched to a different tab, hit paste&hellip; and it worked! Seamless and perfect.</p>
<p>It looks like when you copy slides, your clipboard actually saves a special payload that contains information about the slides you are copying, rather than the raw content. Then when you paste that into a Slides document, it retrieves the slide data from its servers and imports them to the second document. I imagine you have to be logged into the same Google account in both tabs for it to work properly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PKM systems promise coherence, but they often deliver a kind of abstracted confusion. The more I wrote into my vault, the less I felt. A quote would spark an insight, I’d clip it, tag it, link it - and move on. But the insight was never lived. It was stored. Like food vacuum-sealed and never eaten, while any nutritional value slips away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I first started using PKM tools, I believed I was solving a problem of forgetting. Later, I believed I was solving a problem of integration. Eventually, I realized I had created a new problem: deferral. The more my system grew, the more I deferred the work of thought to some future self who would sort, tag, distill, and extract the gold.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always considered my todo list as a list of things I need to do (for obvious reasons). But I had a minor epiphany and realized that, in my current role, everything I do has exactly zero value <em>until I communicate it to the right people</em>.</p>
<p>For example: One big item on my todo list now is to finish writing a proposal for improving how we evaluate new game ideas. But if the overarching objective is &ldquo;<em>Improve how we evaluate new game ideas</em>&rdquo;, the direct actions to achieve this are &ldquo;<em>Convince the right important people and get approval</em>&rdquo;, followed by &ldquo;<em>Tell everybody about the changes</em>&rdquo;. These are accompanied by the prerequisite sub-tasks, &ldquo;<em>Write up a convincing proposal</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>Update the existing guideline documents</em>&rdquo;.</p>

      <p>I was pointed to an <a href="https://cosmographia.substack.com/p/photographs-of-old-japan">article on Cosmographia</a> which in turn shared <a href="https://sova.si.edu/record/fsa.a1999.35?s=0&amp;n=10&amp;t=C&amp;q=japan&amp;i=1">an archive of photos taken in 19th century Japan</a>. These are amazing photos, but what struck me was how <em>familiar</em> some of them felt. Photos taken from 150 years ago should feel like looking into another world, but some of these scenes, the architecture, are still very present today. It makes it clear how cultural artifacts are so remarkably well-preserved here.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/pay-a-subscription/">If you love something, pay a subscription fee</a></h2>
      <p>As a rule of thumb, you are more likely to be satisfied by a service that you pay for directly. This is because paying money makes you a <em>customer</em> of the business, and the business is thereby directly motivated to keep you satisfied.</p>
<p>If you want to find a service that will satisfy you for a long time, <em>paying a subscription</em> is your best bet.</p>
<p>Here are some facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>In general, a business aims to please its customers.</li>
<li>A business&rsquo;s customers are <em>those who pay it money</em>.</li>
<li>If you do not pay money to a business, you are not its customer.</li>
</ol>
<p>A user of a service who does not pay is, strictly speaking, not a customer. In most cases, the needs of the user and the needs of the customer are not too far apart, so many non-paying users are generally satisfied. But on average, in the long run, the needs of the non-user customer and the needs of the non-customer users will drift apart.</p>

      <p><a href="https://fediverse.info">The Fediverse</a>, a network of interconnected social media services, requires users to choose a service for their account, tying their identity to that community. This can be problematic if the community experiences issues like spam, moderation problems, or shutdown. If we could decouple identity from community, like Reddit did with subreddits, users could more freely participate in multiple communities — and the network overall would be more accessible and resilient.</p>

      <p>I'm going to try automatically un-boosting statuses after one week.<br><br>Until now, my usage of boosting was stuck in a mindset that is a remnant of Twitter's culture. Since boosted statuses are displayed on my timeline next to my own words, I find myself boosting statuses that resonate strongly with my own thoughts. "Had I thought of these words first, I may have been the one posting instead" is the metric.<br><br>On Mastodon and the fediverse, I think the recommended usage of boosting is to increase visibility to statuses that I think should be seen more widely. This has noting to do with whether they specifically mirror my own thoughts. "This is good, people should see this" is the metric.<br><br>At the same time I don't want my timeline to be filled with other people's words, so my solution is to automatically un-boost statuses after one week. After the initial boost of visibility, there shouldn't be a reason to have them stuck on my timeline forever. The aim is that this will give me the freedom to boost more widely, and not worry about diluting my own words.</p>

      <p>I initially chose <a href="https://coolify.io/">Coolify</a> as a self-hosted alternative to Heroku when it got too expensive. Coolify makes a lot of things very easy, but I ended up having to dig in to the details and learn a lot to fix things that didn&rsquo;t work. Now that I have learned a fair bit about server management, I&rsquo;ve found that I may no longer need Coolify&rsquo;s hand-holding.</p>
<h2 id="venturing-into-self-hosting">Venturing into self-hosting</h2>
<p>I knew next to nothing about Linux servers, Docker, reverse proxies, and the like.

      <p>This is a really excellent take on minesweeper. Spaces can contain monsters of various strength, and you need to spend HP to defeat them. By collecting EXP and hearts to level up and heal yourself, the goal is to become strong enough to slay the dragon.</p>
<p>It took me a few tries to get a handle on the strategy, but this is super fun!</p>

I've learned, though, that this is because I am privileged.<br><br>For many people, their pronouns are very important. And, unfortunately, there are many who are openly antagonistic towards these people. So it's important for people like me to be openly supportive, to balance the scales if you will.<br><br>"I support your rights to feel however you want to feel about yourself" feels like such a ridiculous thing to say. In a sane world we would never *need* to say that. But look around, guess what. We do need to say it, and we need to say it loudly. So I will.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociable_weaver">sociable weaver</a> is an African bird that creates giant, community nests in trees. The nests look like a giant woolly mammoth hanging in a tree, and have many entry holes on the bottom. These nests can house over 100 pairs of birds, spanning multiple generations at a time.</p>

      <p>I have always been a calm and happy person. Aggressively optimistic, even. I made it through the first 1/3 of my life without feeling much stress, only getting angry on rare occasions. Anger management, emotional therapy, mindfulness exercises, these were all things that I had no need for.</p>
<p>I thought that this was a personality trait, but now I realize that I was simply blessed with an easy life. It&rsquo;s not that I was particularly good at dealing with stress, I just didn&rsquo;t have much stress coming my way.</p>

      <p>I've been really enjoying the slow pace of joining the fediverse. Find a few interesting people to follow, see who they interact with and slowly branch out connections from there.<br><br>In networks with algorithmic feeds, you're presented first with EVERYTHING, and are tasked with filtering out what you don't want until you have a nice curated space. It's stimulating by design, but a little overwhelming. Conversely on the fediverse, you start with NOTHING and slowly add content you like.<br><br>Everything is a preference for sure, this just feels so refreshing to me.</p>

It began as a couple of html pages, and spent time as a Wordpress blog, a Tumblr page, and is now a static blog generated by Jekyll.

<p>When I started this site I had just entered university, got my first MacBook, and was excited to become a full-fledged citizen of the internet. At the time, I thought it was cool to publish as much of yourself as possible. Tag yourself and your friends in the photos you take, scrobble the music you listen to, check in to the places you go, tweet your thoughts. Since I was broadcasting myself to the world, it made sense to put my name on my website. That’s how people would know me.</p>

Compared to Mastodon which required a fair amount of server overhead (more than I could justify for just playing around online), GoToSocial is very <a href="https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/getting_started/#server-vps">lightweight</a>: 1 CPU, 1GB memory, and 15GB-20GB of storage space for the first year or so. Sold!</p>
<p>This would let me set up my own single-user server, which solves all of my misgivings about Mastodon.</p>
<div class="callout">
<div class="title">Disclaimer:</div>
I am a total novice at all things server-related! I am probably at least a little bit wrong about some of the things I write here. Please take my experience with a grain of salt, and correct me if you can.
</div>
<p>I have a VPS with <a href="https://coolify.io">Coolify</a> to manage the multiple apps I have running, and all things considered it makes things very easy.<br>
I used a docker-compose file to deploy GoToSocial, and their <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/main/example/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml">example file</a> was almost perfect as-is.</p>

      <p>For some reason, some sites would not load in Safari. Certain assets, often hosted on a CDN but not always, would hang forever and keep the page from loading. Other browsers worked, curl worked, so it didn&rsquo;t seem like a DNS issue. It was driving me crazy.</p>
<p>I think I finally caught the culprit: Adguard&rsquo;s network filtering.</p>
<p>Adguard gives you the option to filter all of your internet traffic for various apps on your computer. By default, it does so through a &ldquo;Network Extension&rdquo; that registers a local VPN to filter all traffic.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/sorry-the-elevator-is-crowded/">Sorry the Elevator is Crowded</a></h2>
      <p>The elevator in our office building has a small LCD panel that shows information like the current floor, but when the total weight of passengers crosses a certain threshold it also adds a short note: &ldquo;Sorry the elevator is crowded&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It struck me – of all possible features for an elevator display, how did they decide that they needed this one? It has no impact on the elevator&rsquo;s function of moving people vertically. And a crowded elevator is not the elevator&rsquo;s fault (although this is most likely just an example of Japan&rsquo;s self-deprecating approach to hospitality). So why was this message deemed necessary?</p>

It would be interesting to see if a viewer would see any correlation between a person&rsquo;s visual appearance and their taste in music. The prompt &ldquo;What song was playing right now&rdquo; is much more interesting than &ldquo;What is your favorite music,&rdquo; and some people might think that I caught them at just the wrong time, making things more fun for me.</p>

<p>Modern chess is the culmination of centuries of experience, as well as an evolutionary sequence of rule adjustments from its inception in the 6th century to the modern rules we know today. While classical chess still captivates the minds of millions of players worldwide, the game is anything but static. Many variants have been proposed and played over the years by enthusiasts and theorists. They continue the evolutionary cycle by altering the board, piece placement, or the rules—offering players &ldquo;something subtle, sparkling, or amusing which cannot be done in ordinary chess.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>A long time ago, I fancied myself a writer and strove to write beautiful prose. I read a lot and borrowed from styles that I admired, but oftentimes my sentences ran on, and I relied on my thesaurus too heavily. But I enjoyed the process of writing and reached a familiarity with words that allowed me to simply let my thoughts flow through my fingers onto the page.</p>
<p>At university, I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style">The Elements of Style</a> and quickly became an advocate instead of lean, effective prose. I strove to convey my thoughts using fewer words. Composition took more effort as I scrutinized each phrase.

The ruins of these facilities still exist, covered by moss and providing a grim backdrop for those who choose to explore the island.</p>

<ol>
<li>Coat the bottom of a pan with a small amount of oil and place over medium heat.</li>
<li>Put three popcorn kernels in the pan and wait for all three to pop.</li>
<li>Put the rest of the kernels in the pan, cover with a lid, and <strong>remove from the heat</strong> for 30 seconds.</li>

      <h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p>Play Pac-Man online against other players. 1 player plays as Pac-Man and 4 other players play as the ghosts. Pac-Man&rsquo;s goal is to collect as many dots as possible, and the ghosts&rsquo; goal is to work together to catch Pac-Man. Players receive points at the end of the round based on performance, and roles are rotated for the next round.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>In terms of strategy, the ghosts will need to work together in order to win. Pac-Man will move faster than the ghosts, so the ghosts&rsquo; main strategy will be to trap Pac-Man in a corner. To encourage teamwork, all ghosts will receive the same amount of points at the end of round regardless of who actually caught Pac-Man.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot recently about what benefits there are to building a new product on a blockchain. Blockchains allow an app to be decentralized, and the biggest value they bring is a solid way to handle trust and consensus in an environment with no central authority. I was having a hard time thinking of products that would really benefit from being decentralized, but I came across an idea about decentralized platforms that makes a very strong case for using blockchains.</p>

      <p>When I started using Facebook in 2005, it was exclusive to college students and was by far the best way to communicate with my classmates. It was the first time I could learn what my friends were up to without asking each one individually. Everything I wanted to know about my friends was in one easily accessible place.</p>
<p>All recent updates were shown as one long list, but Facebook eventually introduced the News Feed. This was an effort to filter everyone&rsquo;s updates to show just the most important ones. Facebook made educated guesses about whose updates were most important to you and hid the ones you wouldn&rsquo;t care about. I think they also kept an option to see all updates in chronological order if you didn&rsquo;t want to miss out on anything.</p>

      <p>I grew up in the 90s, and back then video games were made for kids. Toys were for kids, and video games were just the newest, most exciting toys around.</p>
<p>But as my generation grew up, we never really stopped playing games. As we became adults, the game companies kept making games for us, and games shifted to targeting an older audience. It makes sense that these would be successful since adults have more money to spend on games than kids do. Video games became a form of entertainment just like movies, and they started using serious storylines and graphic violence in the same ways.</p>

      <p>Google&rsquo;s AlphaZero program is a machine that plays chess, and it has managed to quickly become the strongest chess AI in the world by implementing machine learning techniques. While existing chess AIs have mostly been massive dictionaries of moves that are put together by humans, AlphaZero learned chess entirely on its own with minimal human input.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the hardest part of creating an AI that solves problems like chess is finding some way to calculate if you&rsquo;re winning or not. If that were easy to do, the program could just look at all of its possible moves (which is not very many for a computer) and see which one would leave it winning by more. The trouble is that it&rsquo;s very hard to tell if you&rsquo;re winning. You might need to consider all possible outcomes many moves in advance, which quickly becomes too many to calculate.</p>

<p>Mobile games are generally much more simple than traditional video games, so they can&rsquo;t provide the same rich experiences as traditional video games. Instead, they engage their core users by providing a satisfying experience of winning, especially against other players. Since people often play mobile games in their spare time, money is used as a shortcut to win quickly and efficiently. The entire game&rsquo;s structure is built around creating an environment to support people who are willing to pay large amounts of money in order to win.</p>

<p>I've been thinking a lot about the LGBT rights movement recently. Hopefully this effort can be another step forward following the Civil Rights Movement, as we work towards equal rights and treatment for all.</p>
<p>The Civil Rights Act made it illegal to discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Setting religion aside for a moment, the rest are distinctions that generally lead to noticeable physical differences. The ease of identification is probably one factor that helped the prejudice spread so much, and led to institutional disenfranchisement as well as terrible acts of discrimination and violence.</p>

<p>I still remember the chaos caused by the Monty Hall problem in our high school math class. Here's my explanation for how it works:</p>
<ul><li>Your first choice could either be a car or a goat.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>If you picked the car, you will win the car by not changing your guess.</li>
    <li>If you picked a goat, the host will reveal the second goat. The last door left will be the car, so you are guaranteed to win if you change your guess.</li>
  </ol>
<li>You have two possible strategies to win the car:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Try to pick the car on your first guess, and don't change the guess.</li>
    <li>Try to pick a goat on your first guess, and change the guess after the host opens another door.</li>
  </ol>
<li>The second strategy is better, since picking a goat is twice as easy as picking the car.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best strategy is to <em>try to pick a goat</em> in round 1. Once the host has revealed the second goat, you are guaranteed the car by switching doors.</p>

<p>プレゼンテーションの内容を省略すると、</p>
<p>西洋の空間認識だと、パースペクティブを意識する。
よって、絵の登場人物になりきると視点が変わって絵の全体を意識しなくなる。絵の全体の意識が変わる、と言う方が適切なのかもしれない。</p>
<p>日本の空間認識だと、レイヤーで物を見て、重ねて表現する。
絵の登場人物になりきっても、絵の認識が変わらず、絵の全体を意識し続ける。</p>
<p>これが、日本が産んだマリオやドラクエみたいなプラットフォーマーや、トップダウンRPGなどの表現を作ったゲームの原点で、アメリカではもっと登場人物の視点で遊ぶFPSなどが流行りやすい。</p>
<p>とのこと。</p>
<p>ハードのスペックで3Dの表現ができなかったことも大きい、と想像しつつも、とても興味深い話。</p>
<p>Oculus Rift 用に開発中の<a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/06/oculus-luckys-tale/" target="_blank">Lucky’s Tale</a>の話を思い出した。</p>
<p>Lucky&rsquo;s TaleはVR機能を活かした3Dのプラットフォーマーなのだが、自分が主人公になりきるわけではない。キャラクターの視点と自分の視点は完全に別で、自分が3Dの世界の中で、主人公の隣に居るという見せ方。</p>
<p>開発者曰く、たくさんの案をとにかく作りまくっているうちに偶然出来上がったものだったが、少し遊んでみると体験の斬新さに全員が驚いた、とのこと。</p>
<p>上の話に合わせると、VRなのでパースペクティブで入り込むのはほぼ必須として、それでもマリオのようにキャラと空間の全体の絵を意識し続けれるような、全く新しい形になっているような気がする。おそらく実際遊んでみないと体験を想像できないと思うので、リリースが楽しみだ。</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird">Flappy Bird</a>や<a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a>のようなゲームが見せてくれたように、
根本的な面白い要素さえあれば、どんなシンプルなゲームでも大ヒットする可能性がある。
むしろ、これらのゲームは最もシンプルであることが必須で、根本の面白さの邪魔をする要素がない、というのも成功の要因だと言える。</p>
<p><a href="http://asherv.com/threes/">Threes</a>の製作者は、凄まじい量のブレストと改善を行った上でゲームをリリースした。
その途中で、いずれ2048としてリリースされるゲームシステムを検討したが、彼らの思う「良いゲーム」の定義に当てはまらなく、ボツにされた。
2048のシステムだと、一つの角に寄せて操作すると簡単に高得点が出せるので、それが「正しい」遊び方になってしまう。
おそらく、彼らはゲームとしての深みを重視して、それがゲームの良さを損なうと考え、別のシステムを創った。</p>
<p>結果としては、ゲームの「良さ」を損なうと疑われた要素はゲームの「面白さ」につながり、単純な方のシステムを適用した2048が全世界で大ヒットした。
実際Threesのゲームとしてのクオリティーはかなり高く評価されていて、Threesを否定するわけではない。
ただ、いくら客観的に見てThreesが良いゲームであっても、「2048の方が面白い」と思った人の方が多かった。</p>
<h2 id="面白いを探す">「面白い」を探す</h2>
<p>残念なことに、「面白い」は捕えにくい。一生懸命探せば探すほど、見つからない。
それを見つけるにはとてもクリエイティブな思考が必要で、たまたま得た発想が案外、有益をもたらすことが多い。</p>
<p>自分が新しい物を創る時、なにが面白くなりそうかを考えることに必ずなる。
ただ、これがうまく行くとは限らず、面白い発想が出ない悪循環にもなり得る。</p>
<p>万人の受けを予想しようとすると、現在万人受けしている物を参考にせざるを得ない。
考え始める前から、すでに枠の中に入ってしまっているわけだ。
プロセスはおそらく以下のようになる：</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>人気がある物を見る</li>
<li>なぜそれが面白いかを分析する</li>
<li>その面白さを、新しい形で再現する</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>「新しい形」のところで近道をしている人がありふれたパクリゲームを作ることになるわけだが、
真面目に新しく考えようとしても、既存の物から思考がスタートしている時点で、創れる物の幅が狭くなってしまう。</p>
<h2 id="面白いを発見する">「面白い」を発見する</h2>
<p>プロセスはこうあるべきだ：</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>新しい発想を得る</li>
<li>それを面白くする方法を考える</li>
<li>その面白さに集中して、余計な要素を無くす</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>奇跡的に、<a href="http://pokemon.alexonsager.net">ポケモンフュージョン</a>はこれを果たしていると思う。
ある日その単純な発想が頭に浮かんで、そこに見つけた面白さはシンプルなサイトでも伝わる物だった。</p>
<p>新しい発想を得ることは簡単ではなく、自分ももっと簡単にする方法を探している。
一番大事なことは、自分が興味のあるものを推し進めることだと思う。
「興味深い」の先には必ず「面白い」があると考えていて、そこに行き着くためには自らの熱意が必要。</p>
<p>その先で「面白い」を見つけることができたら、多分それは自分しか見つけることが出来なかった新しい「面白い」であろう。</p>

<p>Yes, you can use punctuation in incorrect ways, but that does not mean there is only one way to use it. A friend recently told me publishers don&rsquo;t care whether you use an oxford comma or not, as long as you pick one and stick with it. This is stupid. If punctuation obscures or distorts the meaning of a sentence in an unintended way, it is wrong, but apart from that, punctuation is about rhythm. An Oxford comma is not a flip switch in an author&rsquo;s voice, it&rsquo;s a decision made in the moment to maintain the flow of the idea. Momentum, syncopation, rhythm and pattern make a sentence flow, because writers are trying to transfer the voices in their heads into yours.</p>

      <p>From <a href="http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/san-francisco-dead-long-live-san-francisco">Gary Kamiya</a> in San Francisco Magazine, talking about the many factors and consequences of San Francisco&rsquo;s economic growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(I)f present trends continue, the city could soon become a moated citadel of info-money, accessible only to venture capitalists, Twitter engineers, and the creators of hookup apps.<br>
[&hellip;]<br>
This prospect worries me. As someone who loves San Francisco’s maverick tradition and its class and ethnic diversity (I celebrated both in a book I wrote last year called Cool Gray City of Love), I find the idea that my beloved town is on the verge of becoming another Manhattan—a picturesque but increasingly expensive, homogeneous, and sterile burg—distressing, to put it mildly.<br>
[&hellip;]<br>
And yet, the political, cultural, and class war that has erupted over what is happening to San Francisco—call it the Change—strikes me as wrongheaded to the point of surreality.<br>
[&hellip;]<br>
I’m all for rushing the barricades when there’s an enemy to fight and a battle that can be won. I’ve engaged in my share of such battles. But it’s time to reckon with reality: There is no enemy here. Or if there is, it’s an enemy that won’t be defeated. What has hit San Francisco in the last couple of years can be summed up in one word: capitalism. And that is a tsunami that no seawall can keep out.</p>

Red carpet ceremonies are events focused on fashion, and Cate Blanchett was wearing a very nice gown that should be seen in its entirety. No, most male guests would not have received the same treatment, because most male guests would be wearing suits or tuxedos and everybody knows what black pants look like.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/replace-text-in-file-osx-service/">Replace Text in File - OSX Service</a></h2>
      <p>A quick Mac OSX service that will search and replace all given strings in a text file, and save the modified content as a new file. It&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> much faster than just opening it in a text editor, but it was a fun way to learn how sed works.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.alexonsager.net/blog/Replace_Text.zip">Download the script here</a></p>
<p>It just runs a simple AppleScript that prompts for the query strings and new filename, and then runs sed through the shell to do the string replacements.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been getting a few questions about the script used to generate the <a href="http://pokemon.alexonsager.net">Pokemon Fusion</a> sprites, so I thought I would write a quick blog post to describe the process.</p>
<p>The inspiration of the website was the idea that it should be possible to automate the process of combining pokemon sprites, and each image is automatically generated by a computer script. Some of the results are less impressive than others, but I think that it adds to the fun and makes it that much more satisfying when you come across ones that work really well.</p>

The situation is desperate now. All of the detainees here are suffering deeply. At least 40 people here are on a hunger strike. People are fainting with exhaustion every day. I have vomited blood.<br>
And there is no end in sight to our imprisonment. Denying ourselves food and risking death every day is the choice we have made.<br>

It’s impossible to play without getting the sense that that its designers really had a lot of fun in conceiving it (barring a stomach ulcer or two) and were wholly dedicated to making sure they got it right. Chrono Trigger is a labor of love effected by a group of very talented game designers, and their enthusiasm for the project permeates every aspect of the experience.</p>

      <p>I might even say that I didn’t grow up in any meaningful way before I started high school.</p>
<p>I’ve always felt like I have very limited memories of middle school and elementary school. The problem, as I realized recently, isn’t that I have few memories. Rather, it is that my memories don’t seem to include my thoughts – what I wondered, what I thought about, and how I felt about certain things. When probing my memories I get plenty of clear images, but I can’t help but feel like an observer; I can see my past-self doing things and reacting to events, but I have no idea what that child was thinking. I mean, I can guess. I’m sure I’d be pretty good at guessing, since I know the kid well, but it’s strange that this isn’t part of the memory.</p>

<p>While a Stanford undergrad, I began my online career with gleeful audacity. The Monday after Facebook Platform launched, my friend and I released Facebook&rsquo;s original Graffiti application. We were unexperienced and had no viral component, so we soon lost the battle to Mark Kantor et al.&rsquo;s version. But Graffiti gave us excitement and hunger. The following fall we enrolled in Stanford&rsquo;s course on Facebook applications, using the opportunity to develop Send Hotness. This time, we nailed the virality. A few advertising payouts later, we were the proud owners of two companies. Doped up on adrenaline, we loved every minute. I stepped down eventually once I remembered that I had schoolwork to do, but I felt sure that this was my path.</p>

Check out the full list of winners on <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2009/05/28/fbfund-17-companies-and-2-nonprofits-win-head-to-palo-alto/">VentureBeat</a> or <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2009/05/28/facebook-announces-19-2009-fbfund-winners/">InsideFacebook</a>.</p>
<p>What this means is that we’ll have Palo Alto office space, lots of media attention, an official Facebook seal of approval, and possibly free lunches <em>/crossfingers</em>. The catch?</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/meals-as-a-social-activity/">Meals as a Social Activity</a></h2>
      <p>Today I ate dinner alone. I think there is nothing wrong with that, but you just don’t see people alone in restaurants all that often (Aren’t you going to be bored? Do you want a magazine or something?). Eating meals, in most cultures everywhere, is regarded as a social activity. I would like to explore why, and have a few hypotheses.</p>
<p><strong>Everybody has to do it</strong>. Three times a day, nearly everybody will eat food at roughly the same time. People share this activity, and so it makes sense for that time to be designated for social interaction. If everybody had tea at 3, or went to the gym at 4, then those would just as strongly be considered a social activity.</p>

      <p>I saw a girl at a bus stop who appeared to have a cigarette in her mouth. &ldquo;Yuck,&rdquo; I thought. Then, I realized it was a lollipop. I immediately wanted to become her friend.</p>
<p>You see, there is something special about lollipops. As far as your mouth is concerned, you could just as well be eating a normal hard candy. But the stick makes a world’s difference. You are proclaiming to the world, <em>&ldquo;I am enjoying a candy.&rdquo;</em> There is no way to be inconspicuous about eating a lollipop. You have committed to this act, and do so with no shame.</p>

      <p>Tuesday, May 5th was Gravity Summit&rsquo;s &ldquo;Social Media Marketing for Business&rdquo; at Stanford. I&rsquo;ve known Rodney Rumford since Joachim and I made Graffiti for Facebook, and he was kind enough to save me a spot.</p>
<p>The focus of the talks was very much aimed towards large businesses; presentations were given by such notable people as Bob Pearson of Dell, Inc. and Charles Miller from DIRECTV. That said, it seemed there were plenty of small business owners attending, and many of the points were generalizable. The main idea is:</p>

      <p>I just ordered Strunk &amp; White&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Elements of Style,&rdquo; 50th anniversary edition. I don&rsquo;t have the book yet, but the purchase inspired me to pay more attention to writing. Hopefully this can be someplace where I can practice writing, incorporating new ideas and polishing my prose. No high hopes yet, as I don&rsquo;t often continue such things for long, but we&rsquo;ll see how it goes :)</p>

      <p>I was at a restaurant last night and saw a couple having dinner together. At a few points, the guy was texting on his phone and the girl was looking really bored. Boo on him. </p><p>And then once he finished he left his phone sitting open on the table. I guess he was expecting replies? Maybe that sort of thing is commonplace now, but I still think it&rsquo;s rude.  </p>

It&rsquo;s done by the guy who made Supersize Me, and chronicles his quest to find Osama Bin Laden. And the trailer plays Gogol Bordello music.</p><p> <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/planetbboy/trailer/" target="_blank">Planet B-Boy</a> - A documentary on the breakdancing culture.

      <p>The other day, a woman asked me if I could spare some change for poor women and children, and my automatic response was to keep walking with no response. Then, as I was walking away she called out to me and said &ldquo;God bless you.&rdquo; Hearing that made me feel like an awful person, because I certainly didn&rsquo;t do anything to deserve it. It was on my mind for a while after that.</p>

      <p>This article is so strange. It shows all the reasons why buying a PC with Windows Vista is a terrible idea, and yet the author seems perfectly happy with his Vista computer, even after paying absurd amounts of money to fix something that shouldn&rsquo;t have broke in the first place.  </p>

      <p>Studies show that people become much more likely to vote if somebody calls them and asks, &ldquo;Are you planning on voting?&rdquo; which is why all of the people who try to promote a certain candidate always start off with that question.</p><p> Could you also ask somebody &ldquo;Are you planning on buying a new Apple computer within the next month?&rdquo; to boost sales?  </p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/why-vote/">Why vote?</a></h2>
      <p>People say that voting doesn&rsquo;t really matter, because in the big picture, one vote for one candidate isn&rsquo;t really going to make that much difference. And this is something that I&rsquo;ve had a hard time coming to terms with too, but I think I figured it out.</p><p>The point of voting is not to ensure that the right person gets elected or that the right ideas get placed in motion, because, as mentioned above, one vote is not really going to make a huge difference. Rather, <i>I think the point of voting is to be aware of the issues and to care about them to the point where you are able to publicly commit to what you believe.</i> Once you have enough people caring about issues and participating in the argument, then you can finally start seeing great changes that save people, nations, and ideals. </p>
