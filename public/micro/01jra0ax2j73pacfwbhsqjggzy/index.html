  <p>I'm going to try automatically un-boosting statuses after one week.<br><br>Until now, my usage of boosting was stuck in a mindset that is a remnant of Twitter's culture. Since boosted statuses are displayed on my timeline next to my own words, I find myself boosting statuses that resonate strongly with my own thoughts. "Had I thought of these words first, I may have been the one posting instead" is the metric.<br><br>On Mastodon and the fediverse, I think the recommended usage of boosting is to increase visibility to statuses that I think should be seen more widely. This has noting to do with whether they specifically mirror my own thoughts. "This is good, people should see this" is the metric.<br><br>At the same time I don't want my timeline to be filled with other people's words, so my solution is to automatically un-boost statuses after one week. After the initial boost of visibility, there shouldn't be a reason to have them stuck on my timeline forever. The aim is that this will give me the freedom to boost more widely, and not worry about diluting my own words.</p>
