      <p>I was pretty optimistic about moving my entire personal site to Quartz, but there are a lot of little nags that make it not great for a blog format.<br><br>No support for pagination, and lots of little issues with RSS are the main ones. Gotta admit that Jekyll just handles it much better.<br><br>Quartz is probably best used for exactly what it says: to transform a folder of assorted Markdown files into a functional website. I think I'll keep my blog as-is, and add Quartz as an auxiliary personal wiki.</p>

      <p>I'm going to try automatically un-boosting statuses after one week.<br><br>Until now, my usage of boosting was stuck in a mindset that is a remnant of Twitter's culture. Since boosted statuses are displayed on my timeline next to my own words, I find myself boosting statuses that resonate strongly with my own thoughts. "Had I thought of these words first, I may have been the one posting instead" is the metric.<br><br>On Mastodon and the fediverse, I think the recommended usage of boosting is to increase visibility to statuses that I think should be seen more widely. This has noting to do with whether they specifically mirror my own thoughts. "This is good, people should see this" is the metric.<br><br>At the same time I don't want my timeline to be filled with other people's words, so my solution is to automatically un-boost statuses after one week. After the initial boost of visibility, there shouldn't be a reason to have them stuck on my timeline forever. The aim is that this will give me the freedom to boost more widely, and not worry about diluting my own words.</p>

      <p>An analogy:<br>I join a social network with the goal of building a space that I like, out of lego pieces.<br><br>The fediverse slowly gives me a few pieces at a time, and I choose what I want. I slowly build out a nice lego structure.<br><br>Networks with algorithmic feeds dump me in a room full of legos, and say I have my pick.

      <p>I've been really enjoying the slow pace of joining the fediverse. Find a few interesting people to follow, see who they interact with and slowly branch out connections from there.<br><br>In networks with algorithmic feeds, you're presented first with EVERYTHING, and are tasked with filtering out what you don't want until you have a nice curated space. It's stimulating by design, but a little overwhelming. Conversely on the fediverse, you start with NOTHING and slowly add content you like.<br><br>Everything is a preference for sure, this just feels so refreshing to me.</p>
