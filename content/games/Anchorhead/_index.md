Anchorhead is a text-based interactive fiction game by Michael Gentry.

I don't have a lot of experience with text-based games, but this one has been very fun. It has a Lovecraftian horror touch, and the prose is excellent.

Like most text-based games with a moderate amount of freedom, I did get stuck a lot. Some of the puzzles and solutions seemed a little bit unreasonable to work out, and I've composed a short list of grievances, linked below.
