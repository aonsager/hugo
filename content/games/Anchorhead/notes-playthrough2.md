- Oh my goodness I died again. Can't waste any time when the monster comes.
	- At least my last save was not too long ago, at the harmonic columns.
- DIED 37/100

### Starting again going to the slaughterhouse

- No wasting time this time. Jump into the well, hide in the bones, and wait
	- This monster is William?
- Got Jeffrey's teddy bear
- Men attack me, forcing me to the church
- I use the meat hook to break the padlock and enter the cellar
- Jump into the stairs, climb out
- This robe looks good for a disguise, but I have to take off my trenchcoat and lose my pockets
- Decided not to read tome

I think I am stuck. I think I have to go back into the temple, but my flashlight died. I can't go to the pub to get a lantern.

Never mind, I used matches to get through the passageway, and luckily the burial mound has light.

- I would have never come up with "cover hole N" to play different notes on the flute. In retrospect it makes sense, but.
- Don't play the flute on the altar, because you will be sacrificed! That's a cute touch.
- I'm not sure what playing the flute did, but hopefully it helped.

_Now_ I have no more light. And I can't get the lantern because I can't reach the pub. Looks like this is the end of this run.

### Things I must do next time

- Get the realtor's key
- Get the lantern
