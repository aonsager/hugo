## Things I must do differently

- Get the gold locket from William's room in the attic
	- Not positive where the key is
- Try to preserve my light source, if I can. There are a lot of dark rooms in this game.

## Day 1

- Get keys from realtor's office
- Get flask from pub
- Get lantern from pub
- Get Michael at library
- Go home
- Sleep

## Day 2

- Get towel
- Take journal from dining room
	- Safe combination: 42-7-38
- Get flashlight
- Get matches
- Get iron key from cellar
- Get silver locket and look at the picture
- Take puzzle box and flute from safe
- Gave whiskey to bum and hear his story
- Show skull to bum
- Get newspaper from town square
- Go to Cauldron
	- Get amulet
	- Open puzzle box and get disk
- Give amulet to bum
	- Get small copper key

## Day 3

- Spy on Michael
- Put disk in telescope and get name "Ialdabaoloth"
- Spin wine bottles
	- C -> W -> H -> E -> M
- Find correct flute holes and play flute
- Go to the slaughterhouse and get the teddy bear
- Go in the church and get the key from the realtor
- Go under the river to the realtor's office
- Getting into the Attic room
	- So there were hints here, and I wasn't clever enough. There is light coming from under door, and the keyhole is the type that people look through. Connect the dots, the solution is not too much of a stretch
	- Slide newspaper under door
	- Here's where the letter opener comes in handy. Push it into the keyhole.
	- Pull the newspaper back
	- Go inside and get the amulet
- To the mill!
- Go to the shanty town, knock on door 11, show the bear, grab the key from the overalls
- Go to the Bare Foundations, search the thickets to find the hatch
- Put towel on the wheel and turn it
- Tie chain to self, and pull lever
- Mirror is 0.0143 (#4)
- Take the caliper and measure the mirrors
- To the lighthouse! Get mugged.

## The last night

- Kick the door down, pick up the glass
- Put glass in the crack, cut jacket
- Open closet, get stuff
- Enter Edward's cell and get the canvas and needle
- Get the magazine, give it to the madman
- Get the key, unlock the gate, leave
- Apparently I can't keep my lantern on in the rain. Makes sense.
- Hide in the alleyway, get the amulet
- Show the gold locket to the monster, then attack it with the hook
- Lets grab the hook again, it's a good weapon
- Maybe go back to the lighthouse?
- I killed Michael!

-- UNDO --

- I have to give the correct mirror to Michael
- I have smudged the correct mirror with fish oil
- I have sabotaged the ritual!
- But I couldn't escape in time

-- RESTORE --

- Pick handcuffs with needle
- Free the boy
- I tried many combinations of jumping to shore, fruitlessly. `Leave island` works.
	- Or just go west!?
- Michael is at the town square
- Follow him into the obelisk
- So I guess I'm not allowed to kill Michael at any point.
- Show wedding ring to Michael
- Put the amulet on Michael
- Can I kill Croseus with the hook?
	- No, he's a ghost
- Play the flute
	- Ugh I forgot which holes. Save and keep restoring till I get it
- FINISHED
