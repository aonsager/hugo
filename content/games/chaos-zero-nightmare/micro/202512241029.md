Thinking about [[Sereniel]].

It seems like she will be very strong, and have good combo potential. But do I need her? Currently, I am working on [[mei-lin]] and [[renoa]] as my main DPS characters for two teams. 

[[Sereniel]] uses Ravage as her main mechanic, which is kind of similar to [[mei-lin]]. I paired [[mei-lin]] with [[Selena]] to try to make use of this, but it ended up not being a very strong mechanic. 

If I were to build [[Sereniel]], I might end up pairing her with [[Selena]], plus either [[mika]] or [[Nia]]. This is pretty similar to my current [[mei-lin]] team, so I'm not sure if I would be adding too much to my roster. The scatter-fire aspect of her missiles might make it more AOE-friendly, I'm not sure. But I have [[renoa]] to do that, so I'm pretty well-covered.

The only things I don't have currently are maybe very strong AOE damage, and something based on shields. I have [[Keyron]] and [[Khalipe]] unlocked though, so what I do need?

Maybe nothing. Maybe I just wait for a character that speaks to me, without needing justification from abilities. We will see...
