Tried a [[mei-lin]] + [[mika]] + [[Cassius]] team, and it worked really well. The card draw was a great help in setting up combos and extending them as much as possible. I have a few good +1AP epiphanies on my Draw cards, so I ended up having a lot of AP left over. I may even be able to drop [[mika]] for [[Veronica]] if I ever draw her. 

My second team remains an unsolved issue, though. I'm going to stick with [[renoa]] + [[Nia]], so if my third is not [[Cassius]] then maybe [[rei]]? Or maybe even move Mika over here.
