When I’m having fun with a hobby, nothing kills my motivation faster than learning about a better, more efficient way I could be doing things. 

I was playing Fantasy Life i – chopping trees, making boots, fishing fish, and just generally having a grand time. It felt like alchemy skills were taking longer than the rest to level up, so i checked a wiki to see if i was missing something. Big mistake. What i learned is that, if i haven’t created 4 sunglasses with EXP boost buffs and then started crafting 10 thousand health potions to power level, I’m wasting my time. 

All of a sudden, the time I spent playing the game felt silly. I could be going so much faster. What am I doing wandering around for half an hour looking for one more clownfish to finish a quest? Put your nose on that grindstone and get to work!

But of course that isn’t true. It’s ridiculous to think there is a *wrong way* to have fun doing what you enjoy. And do you know what happens when you are less efficient progressing through your hobby? You end up spending MORE TIME HAVING FUN doing what you LOVE! Don’t take that away!

But it really does get to me. It’s hard to ignore The Ten Things You Will Definitely Regret Not Learning Sooner. So I do my best not to look things up. And when I inevitably do, I do my best to stay strong, confident in my peaceful pleasure. Good luck on your race – I’m going spelunking.
