  I expected these photos taken from 19th century Japan to feel like looking
  into another world, but what struck me was how familiar some of them felt. It
  makes it clear how cultural artifacts are so remarkably well-preserved here.

I was pointed to an [article on Cosmographia](https://cosmographia.substack.com/p/photographs-of-old-japan) which in turn shared [an archive of photos taken in 19th century Japan](https://sova.si.edu/record/fsa.a1999.35?s=0&n=10&t=C&q=japan&i=1). These are amazing photos, but what struck me was how _familiar_ some of them felt. Photos taken from 150 years ago should feel like looking into another world, but some of these scenes, the architecture, are still very present today. It makes it clear how cultural artifacts are so remarkably well-preserved here.

Here are some photos that stood out to me, alongside their modern-day comparisons.

## Old Japan is ingrained in New Japan

Japan is filled with modern scenes, from sprawling cityscapes to modern skyscrapers, bustling intersections to garish side-streets. Yet often right next to these scenes you can also find elements of an old culture, perfectly preserved and very much of a part of modern life.

I'm sure this is a big part of the country's allure to visitors, to be able to experience not only a foreign culture, but in many cases a culture from a different time as well. It's easy to take for granted when you live here, but it truly is a rare and special environment.
