The [sociable weaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociable_weaver) is an African bird that creates giant, community nests in trees. The nests look like a giant woolly mammoth hanging in a tree, and have many entry holes on the bottom. These nests can house over 100 pairs of birds, spanning multiple generations at a time.
