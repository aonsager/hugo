<p>I just ordered Strunk &amp; White&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Elements of Style,&rdquo; 50th anniversary edition. I don&rsquo;t have the book yet, but the purchase inspired me to pay more attention to writing. Hopefully this can be someplace where I can practice writing, incorporating new ideas and polishing my prose. No high hopes yet, as I don&rsquo;t often continue such things for long, but we&rsquo;ll see how it goes :)</p>
