I've had an idea for a fun art project in my head for many years now, and I don't see myself going through with it any time soon, so I'll compromise by just writing about it.

The idea is to photograph people (with permission) who are wearing headphones in the city. Their photo will be shown along with the song they happened to be listening to. It would be interesting to see if a viewer would see any correlation between a person's visual appearance and their taste in music. The prompt "What song was playing right now" is much more interesting than "What is your favorite music," and some people might think that I caught them at just the wrong time, making things more fun for me.

Since the subjects will generally be preoccupied, I imagine I'd design a small pamphlet that quickly describes the project and hand that out to people who don't look too busy.

Maybe one day.
