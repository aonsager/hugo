The best way to cook popcorn in a pan. The secret is to heat up the kernels evenly in hot oil first, before heating them over a flame to pop them quickly all at once.

1. Coat the bottom of a pan with a small amount of oil and place over medium heat.
2. Put three popcorn kernels in the pan and wait for all three to pop. 
3. Put the rest of the kernels in the pan, cover with a lid, and **remove from the heat** for 30 seconds.
  - This heats the kernels evenly, getting them all ready to pop together.
4. Return the pan to the heat, where the popcorn should start popping right away.
  - It helps to keep the lid ajar and shake the pan occasionally to keep the popcorn dry.
5. Once the popping slows to a few seconds between pops, pour the popcorn into a bowl.
6. Add salt to taste.
