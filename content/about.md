## About me

<img src="/images/alex_face.png" width=200 height=200 style="float:right; margin-left: 15px;" title="My face" alt="A photo of me sitting at an outdoor terrace, smiling and trying to keep my eyes open in the bright sunlight." />

My name is Alex. I grew up near Boulder, CO and spent most of my childhood reading books, playing music, and playing video games. I learned programming by making bad games for my TI-83 calculator. The first things I published online were bad flash websites.

In college I studied programming and human-computer interaction. A team of classmates and I made [a few apps](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/These-Stanford-Students-Made-Millions-Taking-A-2361888.php) on Facebook, which eventually turned into a startup. This was the first time I made something that was used by a large number of people. It became my introduction to making real products that have users and make money.

I have been working at a mobile game company in Japan since 2010. Because my day-job doesn't currently involve much programming, I like to work on fun [[projects]] on the side that let me build things directly. You can read a little bit more about what I am doing [[now]].

Part of the reason I maintain this site is the hope that it will help me make more connections online. Please feel free to [[contact|get in touch]]! It would make me very happy.

## About this site

I write notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to transform my notes into a functional website. You can look at the [[Colophon]] for information about how this site is built. I have a running list of [[todos| todos]] that I want to take care of.

I'm still not sure what the best way to organize things is here, so they might be a lot of reorganizing for a while. For now, the vision is to just tag everything and see what happens. Maybe I will make a tag cloud to aid exploration. Maybe I will expose a list of related pages for each page. I'm not sure yet, but I think I have a lot of options.
