If you want to get notified of new posts, this is for you.

- [posts.xml](/posts.xml) contains all new blog posts
- [links.xml](/links.xml) contains all quick links I make to interesting sites 
- [feed.xml](/feed.xml) is a combination of the above two feeds

I also tend to publish things to my [Fediverse](https://gts.invisibleparade.com/@alex) account if you'd like to follow me there.

Check out [this resource](https://aboutfeeds.com/) to learn more about web feeds and how you can use them.
