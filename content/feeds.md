If you want to get notified of new posts, this is for you.

- [[/feed.xml]] contains all new blog posts
- [[/links.xml]] contains all quick links I make to interesting sites 
- [[/all.xml]] is a combination of the above two feeds

I also tend to publish things to my [Fediverse](https://gts.invisibleparade.com/@alex) account if you'd like to follow me there.

Check out [this resource](https://aboutfeeds.com/) to learn more about web feeds and how you can use them.
