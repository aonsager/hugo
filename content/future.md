Things I am looking forward to in...

## The year 2026

### Fridays
Kid2 will enter kindergarten, which means a sudden increase in time with no kids in the house. Since I work remotely on Fridays, this creates some opportunities for precious free-time.

It will be really nice to be able to spend some quiet time during the day with my wife. I would love to have semi-regular lunch dates.

The kids' swimming school has a plan that lets parents of enrolled kids use the pool freely for a very reasonable monthly fee. I want to start swimming on Friday mornings. I'm terrible at swimming, but I do want to get better, and I'm hopeful that it will be a good source of exercise. 

### Gaming with the kids

Kid1 has been playing on our Switch, and he's getting pretty good at Kirby Discovery. In 2026 we will probably branch out into more games, and I'm excited to go through that experience with him.

In addition to video games, we've been playing Othello and Shogi together, which is also a lot of fun. I want to keep this up, and also start branching into other board games and card games. 

Kid2 can almost follow the rules of Candy Land, so family game nights are maybe not too far off.

## My 30s (2017–2026)

(I'm almost done already so this is kind of cheating, but)

This is the decade where I grow my family and solidify my life. 

- I want to have kids, hopefully 2. 
- It would be nice to buy a house, but that requires thinking about where we want to live. USA vs Japan is a big choice.
- I should probably think about growing into a new role at work. I still feel like one of the young guys, but I'm actually getting fairly senior.
- I want to stay healthy, so that I'm not hampered physically when interacting with future kids.

## My 40s (2027–2036)

This is the decade where my kids grow into their teens (wow that is terrifying).

- I want to be a strong, supportive parent in my kids' lives.
- I want to help them to grow into whatever they will become, without being too heavy-handed in what _I think_ they should become.
- I want to adjust into having more time for myself at home, while the kids start doing their own things more and more. I want to be a productive and contributing member of our family.
- I might be able to put more time and effort into work. This may include leading the production of a game myself.
- I want to put more active effort into staying healthy and fit.

## My 50s (2037–2046)

This is the decade where my kids will go through high school and college, eventually going off as adults.

- I want to give my kids whatever they need to be successful, independent adults. 
- I want to find a good, strong relationship with my kids as a pair of adults. I'm not sure how hard this transition will be.
- I want to continue to stay healthy and fit.

## My 60s (2047–2056)

Somewhere in here I hope to retire. I'm am really looking forward to my retirement! Writing down the things I want to do was a big motivator to putting together this document.

- I want to travel with my wife. It doesn't have to be a lot, but there is a list of places we want to go and I don't want to ignore it.
- I want to spend more time in my local community. Exploring small local shops, visiting the library, little things like that that tend to fall through the cracks.

## My 70s (2057–2066)

More of the same? I'm not really sure yet. I'll leave this (and the rest) blank.
