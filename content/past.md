Based on my aspirations for the [[future]], these are reflections on how things actually went in...

## The year 2025

- For the first time in my life, I successfully maintained a physical journal for the entire year.

## My 30s

For the most part, things went surprisingly smoothly, according to a loose plan.

- I committed to living in Japan long-term. 
- I bought a house here in a great, friendly neighborhood.
- I got married, and we have two wonderful kids.
- I transferred into a senior role at work, and it has turned out to be extremely fulfilling. I am very lucky.
