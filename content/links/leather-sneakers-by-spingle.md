[Spingle](https://www.spingle.jp/en/) is a company based in Hiroshima, Japan that makes hand-crafted leather shoes, and they also have an excellent [sneaker lineup](https://www.spingle.jp/en/spingle_move/). Because the leather molds to your feet over time, the shoes become more comfortable the more you wear them.

They are a little pricey, but they should last a long time and the cost is completely reasonable considering the work that goes into them. And there are plenty of sneakers that cost even more.
