From [Martin A. Schwartz](https://web.stanford.edu/~fukamit/schwartz-2008.pdf):

> Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. Focusing on important questions puts us in the awkward position of being ignorant. One of the beautiful things about science is that it allows us to bumble along, getting it wrong time after time, and feel perfectly fine as long as we learn something each time.

There seems to be a constant pressure to be "right", but there are definitely situations where that's impossible. Sometimes, being wrong is correct. It's getting harder and harder to allow ourselves to enjoy bumbling and exploring, but it is so important.
