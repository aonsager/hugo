This looks like a pretty neat interactive fiction game, by Michael Gentry. Excited to give it a shot.

> This is a pretty enormous game. There are lots of rooms to explore and lots things to mess with, and they don't all necessarily contribute directly to solving the game. Don't be daunted. Don't spend too much time banging your head against a locked door -- many of the keys only come to you in the course of time, as the story develops. If you're at a loss for what to do next, wander around to the places you've already been -- they may have changed since the last time you visited. Don't forget to look 'under' and 'behind' things, as well as 'in' and 'at' them. And hang on to your umbrella.
