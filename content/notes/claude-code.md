I've started using Claude Code's Pro plan for personal programming projects, and it's unbelievable how useful this is as a tool. I've sort of known it for a while, but I can't comprehend a future where using coding assistants like this is a no-brainer.

It helps a lot that I have programming experience, and experience managing large projects. Created structured steps and guiding Claude through the workflow feels natural, and I'm already getting solid results. This can only improve as I gain more experience, and the tools become more powerful.
