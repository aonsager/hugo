~~I have a page at [[/external-links]] that lists all external sites that I have linked to from this website.~~

~~To do this, I created a custom [Emitter](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/advanced/making-plugins#emitters) that detects all external links as the site is being built. It then outputs a page at [[/external-links]] that lists these links in chronological order, by the date that the linking page was published.~~

~~I wanted some kind of linked list as part of my webpage, but I wasn't sure what in format to save the data. This seems like it should work pretty well, because "I cared enough to write about it" is a pretty good heuristic for things that I found interesting. ~~

~~And while [Obsidian's web clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper) never really clicked for me before, using it as a quick way to add a new page to my site and link to the source is a pretty compelling workflow.~~

Instead, I've decided to go back to my earlier process of adding a `link` property to notes that are about an external webpage.

And using [Obsidian's web clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper) makes a lot more sense to me now, because the goal is to display the information in a public post.
