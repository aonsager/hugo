I'm probably going to end up tweaking this class a lot.

## Don't show tags on the page list

It just takes up too much space.

_Delete the tags element from the returned HTML string._

## Custom display for subfolders

I wanted to make the distinction between a folder and a file clear, so a folder now shows an icon to indicate that it's a folder.

I also wanted to show how many pages were contained within a subfolder, but that was a little bit complicated.
