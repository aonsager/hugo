Notes about how I use Obsidian

## Community plugins

The only one that I consider to be essential is [Quick Add](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/). This is a very powerful plugin that lets me automate a lot of convenient things:

### Quick command to create new pages from a template

I have a standard template of frontmatter for blog posts, and made a command that fills it in for me.

### Quick command to fill in frontmatter based on existing content

I have a script to [[adding-color-to-posts-automatically | add colors to posts]], and this plugin lets me run the script as a quick command. 

## Vault location

Because I access my Obsidian Vault on both desktop and mobile, the vault is saved in a weird location in my iCloud drive:

```
~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Obsidian/
```

You need to create vaults from your mobile device, and then open that vault from your desktop device after it has been created.

Keeping the folder in your iCloud drive always downloaded makes sure nothing weird happens, and is a good way to get sync for free.
