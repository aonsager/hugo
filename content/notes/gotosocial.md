[GoToSocial](http://gotosocial.org) is an ActivityPub server written in Go. It matches most Mastodon functions, and allows for fairly seamless interaction with existing sites and apps.

I use it as a single-user instance to participate in the Fediverse. I didn't want to join an existing Mastodon server for [[i-want-to-love-mastodon | a variety of reasons]], and GoToSocial is super light-weight, making it easy to install on my personal VPS.

The server is hosted at https://gts.invisibleparade.com and you can reach me there as [@alex](https://gts.invisibleparade.com/@alex)
