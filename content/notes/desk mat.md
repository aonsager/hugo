## Currently using

30cm×85cm wool desk mat from [amesoba](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CRPZZBFS).

This desk mat is fantastic. The natural wool material has been treated to have none of the typical scratchiness, and it's comfortable for my wrists while giving a smooth surface for a mouse, too. 

30×90 is a more standard size, but 90cm felt a little bit too big for me, so this 85cm width is perfect.

One thing I should note is that there is no rubber on the bottom to prevent the mat from sliding. I have never had a problem with it (maybe because I have a heavy keyboard) but it is something to keep in mind. One the plus side, it's reversible!

Ah, I just noticed that you can opt for having a cork bottom for a little bit extra. I totally missed that when I bought mine!

## Using at work

Cashmere desk pad from [Minimal Desk Setups](https://shop.minimaldesksetups.com/products/desk-pad?variant=47324556951745)

This desk pad is also great! There is nothing really wrong with it, but there are two things that makes me prefer the amesoba.

1. There is just a touch of the wool scratchiness. Not enough to bother me, or be a problem, but enough that I do notice it.
2. As mentioned about, the 90cm width felt a little bit too much. My desk was really dominated by the mat. I wouldn't have thought that 5cm would make such a difference, but here we are.

## Returned

I also tried this desk mat from [BREENHILL](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0C16R4SGF).

I got it because it was cheap, and it was fine, but not joyous. I'm just being picky here, but the above two mats actually made me look forward to sitting at my desk, whereas the BREENHILL was more just... there. But it should be a perfectly good, budget-friendly option if that's what you're looking for.
