At the end of every post, I display list of related posts. Currently, this list is determined by looking at the number of tags in common with the current page. The idea is that if there are multiple common tags, it is pretty likely that the two posts are closely related.

This is a pretty simple heuristic that works pretty well. I think that to make it more effective though, I need to be more conscious of how I tag each post – right now it's pretty random and there are probably a lot of near-misses.

I'm also interested to see if there are any other ways to surface related posts. This is an area where I want to continue to try different things.
